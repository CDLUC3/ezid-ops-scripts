,22UB-2311,Closed,Epigenetic markers for pesticide exposure and cancer risk,California Breast Cancer Research Program,CBCRP - CBCPI Request for Proposal (RFP),Imported,1249970,2016-10-01,2022-03-30,Hannah Park,hlpark@uci.edu,"University of California, Irvine",,CBCRP Program Initiative,Etiology and Prevention,"Non-technical overview of the research  topic and relevance to breast cancer: 

  Pesticides,  including insecticides and herbicides (weed killers), pose a threat to human  health. Organophosphate pesticides (OPs) are the most commonly used insecticides in the U.S., and glyphosate is the most commonly used  herbicide. The proposed project focuses on identifying biomarkers for exposures  to these two types of pesticides. A few studies have shown that exposure to OPs and glyphosates may be  associated with increased breast cancer risk in humans and that they increase cell division and disrupt hormone  signaling in breast cancer cells and animal models. However, additional  studies are needed to determine if exposure to these pesticides increase breast  cancer risk in humans.



  Research question(s) or central  hypotheses: 

  We  hypothesize that methylation in blood cell DNA is associated with urinary  measures of OP and glyphosate exposure, and that some sites of DNA methylation  will be identified that can serve as biomarkers for the exposures. Given that  OPs and glyphosates disrupt hormone signaling, we also hypothesize that the  biomarkers will be associated with known hormone-related breast cancer risk  factors like breast density and age at menopause, which would increase our  understanding of how DNA methylation relates to breast cancer development.



  General methodology:

  400  women from the UCI Athena Breast Health Network, a cohort of >7,000 breast  screening patients at UC Irvine who agreed to participate in research, will be  recruited to participate in the study, which includes filling out study surveys  and donating a blood sample and two urine samples. Study participants will be  offered a personalized report containing their urinary levels of OP metabolites  and glyphosate in comparison to national averages and averages among the study  cohort, as well as access to the study physician if they have any questions  about their report or their breast cancer risk. Methylation arrays will be used  to determine methylation levels at >850,000 DNA sites, and the sites that  are most correlated with urinary levels of OP metabolites and glyphosate will  be identified as biomarkers for OP and glyphosate exposure.



  Innovative elements:

  This study has  the potential to transform the field of breast cancer research related to  environmental exposures because the DNA methylation markers will allow for more  cost-effective, large scale analysis of samples collected in prospective  studies as well as previously established cohorts in order to elucidate the  relationship between the most commonly used pesticides in the U.S. and breast  cancer risk, which may lead to changes in policy regarding use of these  pesticides in order to protect human health. A better understanding of whether  these pesticides affect breast cancer risk may help women make more informed decisions  regarding pesticide exposures for herself and her loved ones.



  We will use the  most up-to-date methylation array to analyze >850,000 DNA sites, the most  sites out of all arrays currently available. Previous array analyses which  analyzed fewer sites led to numerous discoveries of specific sites of DNA  methylation being associated with various aspects of human health, including  smoking status, and we anticipate that this new array will enable the discovery  and validation of a statistically significant panel of methylation markers  associated with pesticide exposure. 



  Advocacy involvement and relevance to  the human issues associated with breast cancer:

  Three  experienced breast cancer research advocates comprise my Advocate Team for this  study. They helped in the development of the specific aims, including the  decision of which pesticides to study, and in development of the recruitment  strategy. The protocol and all participant-facing materials will be vetted by  the Advocate Team before implementation. The proposed study is extremely  relevant to women who are eager to know about their breast cancer risk,  especially those risk factors that can be avoided. There is suspicion among  many women about the relationship between pesticides and breast cancer risk.  The proposed study would help clarify this relationship.

","The overall goals of the project were to define and validate a panel of CpG sites whose methylation is associated with pesticide exposure and determine if these markers are associated with specific breast cancer risk factors. We achieved these goals and more. The data and biospecimens that were collected from this study will be mined for years to come. 

Major accomplishments include:
•	We recruited 400 postmenopausal women in southern California to participate in our study. Their generous contributions included study questionnaires, dietary recalls, a food frequency questionnaire, blood, first-void urine (x2), and saliva samples, and access to their electronical health records. 
•	The urine samples were analyzed for the most heavily used pesticide in the world, the weed killer glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup), as well as its metabolite, AMPA. We identified DNA methylation loci in several cancer-related genes that are associated with urinary glyphosate or AMPA.
•	We used machine learning to develop a DNA methylation index which could predict urinary glyphosate levels with 74% accuracy.
•	We identified DNA methylation loci that are associated with breast density, which is a strong breast cancer risk factor.
•	A novel DNA methylation analysis pipeline to identify stable (replicable) results was developed and shown to be effective.
•	3 peer-reviewed manuscripts have been published so far, and 4 posters were presented at the American Society for Human Genetics and American Association for Cancer Research meetings.

Future activities will include using the rich data and biospecimen repository to conduct additional analyses to identify epigenetic markers for other lifestyle/environmental exposures, such as bisphenols, measures of healthy eating (Healthy Eating Index), and total duration of estrogen exposure. We are also conducting a study to explore the potential relationships between urinary glyphosate/AMPA and blood levels of sex hormones and the inflammatory marker c-reactive protein, both of which are related to breast cancer risk."
,23UB-7320,Closed,ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON INFLAMMATION AND CANCER DEVELOPMENT,California Breast Cancer Research Program,CBCRP - CBCPI Request for Proposal (RFP) - 2017,Imported,788340,2017-04-01,2022-09-30,Donald Lamkin,dlamkin@ucla.edu,"University of California, Los Angeles",,CBCRP Program Initiative,Etiology and Prevention,"Non-technical overview of the research topic and relevance to breast cancer: Many breast cancer risk factors, by themselves, are only modestly associated with an increased chance for developing breast cancer. However, women may be exposed to several of these risk factors in their lives, and this combination of factors may ultimately increase their risk to a level far greater than that from either factor by itself. Of the many factors that may contribute to development of breast cancer, we plan to examine the combined effect of a suspect environmental chemical and an environmental social stressor. Clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that stress-related psychological factors in breast cancer patients, such as lack of social support, can associate with accelerated development of the disease and may do so by increasing the body's inflammation response. Likewise, certain environmental chemicals are hypothesized to act as tumor promoters through their effects on the body's inflammation response. Although animal models have been utilized to examine the effects of these factors individually on adverse health outcomes, rarely have both factors been examined at the same time and never at the same time in relation to breast cancer development. Among the several environmental chemicals that are hypothesized to induce systemic low-grade inflammation and promote tumor development are bisphenol A (BPA), which is used in plastic food packaging, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are flame retardant chemicals in textiles, foams, and plastics. Among the several laboratory stressors that researchers use to induce stress is social isolation, where the mouse is housed alone instead of in a group. Given that rodents are a social species that abide in groups, social isolation in female mice is seen as a form of stress that may be analogous to deprivation of social support in humans. Thus, we will examine the effect of each suspect environmental chemical, in combination with social isolation, on mammary gland inflammation and tumor development. 


Research question(s) or central hypotheses:  Our first hypothesis is that mice exposed to a suspect environmental chemical and social stress have higher levels of mammary gland inflammation and greater development of tumor than mice exposed to just one of these factors or no factor. Our 2nd hypothesis asserts that mice exposed for longer time periods have higher levels of inflammation and greater development of tumor. This is based on the notion that longer duration equates to a higher ""dose"" of these pro-tumor factors. Our 3rd hypothesis acknowledges the possibility that ""young age"" may represent a window of increased vulnerability. We assert that mice exposed at an earlier age (pre-puberty) have higher levels of inflammation and greater development of tumor than mice exposed at older ages (post-puberty, post-pregnancy). 

 
General methodology:  Standard mouse models of breast cancer promotion will be used. After laboratory mice are randomly assigned to one of the experiment's conditions, they will undergo exposure to an environmental chemical for 12 weeks (in group or isolated housing) before a relatively small number of breast cancer cells are injected into the mammary gland. Mice in each group will then be monitored for another 4 weeks so that effects of exposure and social isolation on tumor development can be determined. Mammary gland will then be collected from each mouse so that effects of exposure and isolation on inflammation can be analyzed. 


Innovative elements:  This study may contribute to a major paradigm shift in our understanding of how environmental chemicals affect breast cancer risk: they increase low-grade inflammation in the body--an idea that is relatively new to cancer biology. In addition to measuring tumor size with standard handheld calipers, we will also be able to assess the metastatic potential of tumors by using imaging technology during tumor development to see if the growing tumor inside the living mouse has metastasized to other organs. This study also uses a genomics approach, which entails collecting tens of thousands of data points on gene expression from each mouse in the project, which will be shared on a public repository for other researchers to analyze. 


Advocacy involvement and relevance to the human issues associated with breast cancer:  Dr. Sandra Finestone, Director of the Hope Wellness Center in Irvine, California, is serving as the advocate on this proposal. As both a breast cancer survivor and clinical psychologist, Dr. Finestone provides counseling and social support to hundreds of women with breast cancer. Given her professional knowledge of the kinds of human stress that may impact upon breast cancer development, Dr. Finestone will provide ongoing feedback on the methods by which we aim to generate analogous stress hormone responses in laboratory mice that can impact mammary cancer development. She will also disseminate our findings to the breast cancer community. 

","The overall goal of the project was to examine the effects of suspect environmental chemicals in combination with a social stressor (isolation) on inflammatory signaling and tumor development in mouse models of breast cancer. All initially planned experiments for Aim 1 that examined the main and interaction effects of social isolation with two different environmental chemicals were completed, but because no effects were found on tumor progression in those experiments, we pivoted to an alternative transgenic model of breast carcinogenesis to further test the project's main hypothesis. The transgenic model was slower and required overcoming the initial barriers of gaining new ethics approval at UCLA and then acquiring breeders to generate a mouse colony. Because this alternative model took longer, it forced postponement of work on Aims 2 and 3, but the results ultimately were illustrative for the molecular results we had found in the initial experiments of Aim 1. Such results from bioinformatic analyses of the functional genome in mammary tissues had suggested there was a deficit in tumor immunosurveillance at the basic innate level of immunity (rather than enhanced low-grade inflammation) as a function of chronic low-dose exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether 47 (PBDE-47). Thus, a more gradual model of evolving oncogenesis in genetically predisposed subjects was needed to determine whether such a deficit would associate with greater tumor development. Replication of our PBDE exposure protocol in these latter transgenic mice indeed resulted in greater tumor development. Both of those results (relative lack of inflammatory signaling and greater tumor development) complemented our additional work on assaying levels of PBDE-47 in mammary tissue following low-dose long-term exposure. Accumulative levels of PBDE-47 in the mice were representative of higher-end levels reported in human breast tissue. This was an important finding, because it indicated that PBDE's effects on lower innate tumor immunosurveillance and greater tumor development can be induced at a level that is on par with that currently found in the environment. Our hope is that future research will build upon the results of this project by pursuing our novel theory that persistent PBDEs may actually function like a persistent viral infection that paradoxically induces a deficit in innate immunity."
,24AB-1300,Closed,Physical activity intervention for young cancer survivors,California Breast Cancer Research Program,CBCRP - CRC Pilot Award - 2018,Imported,107972,2018-08-01,2021-01-31,Sheri Hartman,sjhartman@ucsd.edu,"University of California, San Diego",Stori Nagel;,Community Research Collaboration Award,Etiology and Prevention,"Introduction: The purpose of this study is to explore the benefits of physical activity for young breast cancer survivors between the ages of 18-49. Young breast cancer survivors often have many negative effects from their cancer treatments at a time when they are just beginning their adult lives. Compared to older breast cancer survivors, they have a greater chance of cancer recurrence, sexual dysfunction, depression, fatigue, low self-esteem, and negative thoughts about their body. Haus of Volta, and its founder Stori Nagel, noticed that physical activity was helpful for herself and many other young breast cancer survivors in readjusting to life after cancer treatments. Haus of Volta is interested in learning whether being physical active could help any of the common complaints among young survivors, and how to help fellow young breast cancer survivors be more active.



Question(s) or hypotheses: We hypothesize that being physically active and being connected to other survivors could greatly improve many symptoms young survivors experience. We want to answer these questions: 1) is increasing physical activity helpful for young breast cancer survivors’ quality of life, and 2) how can young breast cancer survivors support each other to be more physically active?



General methodology: First, we will train 4 young breast cancer survivors to be peer mentors for the physical activity intervention. Second, we will enroll 20 breast cancer survivors (under age of 50, greater than 6 months out of treatment, and currently not active) into a 12-week physical activity program. The program includes a Fitbit and associated apps to encourage and track physical activity, and peer support through an online message board and regular phone/video calls. Each participant will receive tailored support from a trained peer mentor. At the start of the intervention and twelve weeks later, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires measuring body image, self-esteem, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sexual health. A small device to measure physical activity will be mailed to participants to wear on their hip for 7 days at the start of the intervention and at twelve weeks. At the end of the study, participants and peer mentors will be interviewed to get their perspective on the intervention and ways to improve it and make it sustainable. 



Innovative elements: This study is innovative because it will test more convenient methods of helping young breast cancer survivors increase their activity by being completely remote and requiring no in-person contact. Using Fitbits and the Fitbit Coach app combined with peer support, we will test if we can help young cancer survivors add in activity to their busy, ever shifting schedules. An online message board through Fitbit will help them connect with other young cancer survivors in the study and support each other in reaching their goals. 



Community involvement: Haus of Volta is a nonprofit that has been working specifically with young breast cancer survivors since 2015. The founder, Ms. Nagel, has also been working as a State Leader for the Young Survival Coalition since 2014. The Haus of Volta’s close relationship with the young breast cancer survivor community led to this research question and plan. For this project, Haus of Volta will be involved in recruitment, as peer mentors to the women in the study, and interpreting the results. Haus of Volta will also use its connections with the larger young breast cancer survivor community to share the results of the study. 

","Young breast cancer survivors (YBCS) often have poor quality of life (QOL) compared to older survivors. One potential way to improve QOL is through physical activity, but this has been understudied in YBCS. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation of a peer-delivered, fully remote intervention to improve physical activity and QOL in YBCS.
Participants completed six video sessions with a trained YBCS peer mentor; self-monitored PA with a Fitbit activity tracker; and interacted with a private Fitbit Community for social support. At baseline, 3, and 6-months, participants completed validated QOL questionnaires and PA was measured through accelerometer. A parallel mixed methods approach (qualitative interviews and quantitative satisfaction survey) explored feasibility and acceptability. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA examined impacts on PA and QOL at 3-and 6-months. 
On average, participants (N=34) were 43.1 plus or minus 5.5 years old, 46 plus or minus 34.4 months post-diagnosis, and self-reported a BMI of 30.2 plus or minus 7.4 kg/m2. The intervention was feasible as evidenced by efficient recruitment, high retention, and adherence to intervention components. Remote delivery was highly acceptable, as were working with a peer mentor and using the suite of Fitbit tools. Participants showed meaningful improvements in physical activity, body image, fatigue, anxiety, and emotional support. There were no changes in self-reported sexual function. Peer mentors were interviewed about their experiences delivering the program and analysis of these interviews is ongoing.
Haus of Volta plans to continue supporting body positivity and healthy choices for optimal survivorship. Increasing the visibility of survivors of color living an active life post treatment is imperative to creating visibility for them in the community and encouraging other to follow. Evolving with technology is essential to reaching survivors across age ranges. Haus of Volta will continue to use and expand on their Youtube, Facebook, and Instagram (Fitavivor) stories to support living an active lifestyle. Fellow survivors, that have a Fitbit, will be invited to join the (pinkbodyspirit) Fitbit community. Haus of Volta will utilize the training and skills gained through this community partnership grant to continue supporting the health and well-being of younger breast cancer survivors."
,24BB-2300,Closed,Reducing Latina Women's Exposure to Cleaning Chemicals,California Breast Cancer Research Program,CBCRP - CRC Full Research Award - 2018,Imported,629565,2018-08-01,2021-07-31,Kim Harley,kharley@berkeley.edu,"University of California, Berkeley",Norma Morga;,Community Research Collaboration Award,Etiology and Prevention,"Introduction: Although household cleaning products contain a wide variety of chemicals, these ingredients are often not required to be listed on the label. Some household cleaning products, including floor, window and bathroom cleaners, furniture polish, air fresheners, and other cleaning agents, have been shown to contain chemicals that are known or suspected to cause cancer or disrupt hormones. Research shows that Latina women use more cleaning products than women of other races and ethnicities, suggesting that they may be at increased risk of exposure. However, little is known about the extent that women are exposed to these chemicals of concern during routine housecleaning or how they might reduce their exposure. 



Research Questions: We aim to characterize the household cleaning products used by Latina women, learn which chemicals are in these products, measure the chemicals in the air that women breathe during routine cleaning, and determine whether these concentrations in air decrease when they replace their products with “green” or “low chemical” cleaning products and are educated on ways to reduce exposure. 



Methods: This study will take place in the Salinas Valley, CA, an agricultural region with a large Latino farmworker population, where our community-researcher collaboration has a long-standing, community-based project. Our group facilitates a Salinas-based Youth Council (YC) of high school students interested in health environmental leadership. We will train the YC in research methods and work with them to design the study, develop questionnaires, conduct interviews and sample collection, analyze data, and disseminate results. The YC will recruit 80 Latina women living in or near Salinas and interview them about their household cleaning product use. At an initial home visit, each study participant will wear a small personal air monitoring device while she cleans her house using her usual products. Then, at a second home visit a few days later, the YC members will educate the participant on how she can reduce exposures to cleaning products, provide alternative “green cleaning” products, and collect a second air sample while she cleans her house with the new products. Air samples will be analyzed for the presence of 13 chemical classes of concern and we will determine whether chemical levels decreased when she changed cleaning products. We will also conduct laboratory analyzes to determine the chemical contents of several cleaning products of concern. 



Innovation. This study will be conducted primarily by youth. By employing teens to conduct the research, we will be empowering them, giving them marketable skills, creating job opportunities and raising their interest in science, community issues, breast cancer, and the environment. In addition, by engaging teens in the dissemination, education, and advocacy portion of the study, we are increasing our outreach. We hope that simple messages demonstrating chemical exposures in the air that women breathe while cleaning and showing how to reduce these exposures will have a powerful impact. In our work in the Salinas Valley, we have learned that children, often more acculturated and fluently bilingual, are a conduit for educating parents. Thus, through youth, we hope to raise community awareness about breast cancer and chemicals in the environment. 



Community Involvement. The proposed study is rooted in the 20 year-old CHAMACOS community- university partnership between the Center for Environmental Research and Children’s Health (CERCH) and Clinica de Salud del Valle Salinas (CSVS). CHAMACOS partners have engaged in extensive environmental health education activities, reaching over 30,000 residents. The CHAMACOS project is guided by a Community Advisory Board with input from the YC, Grower Council, and Farmworker Council. For this project, the CHAMACOS partnership will work with the YC in conducting all phases of the study. The YC, in partnership with CERCH and CSVS, and in consultation with other breast cancer and environmental advocacy groups, will develop education materials and strategies to reduce household cleaning product exposures in the Latino community based on results of the study.



Future Plans. We aim to disseminate the results of this study to local and statewide medical, health, and social service agencies involved in the health of Latino communities. The YC has engaged youth in environmental health research since 2010 and we hope to continue this tradition. As the youth graduate from high school, their participation in the YC helps prepare them for college and their careers.

","Many household cleaning products contain endocrine disrupting and carcinogenic chemicals that may contribute to breast cancer risk. Latina women may be at particular risk due to their increased use of cleaning products. 

The Lifting Up Communities through Interventions and Research (LUCIR) Study is a youth-led project to characterize how Latina women are exposed to chemicals in household cleaning products and to determine whether they can reduce these exposures by switching to “green” or “low chemical” products. The study also aims to educate community members to reduce their exposure to cleaning chemicals and to empower local high school students as environmental health leaders.

We have been very successful in meeting our study aims. This project was conducted by the CHAMACOS Youth Council, a youth empowerment and environmental health project based in Salinas, California. Youth Council members were involved in all aspects of the study design, implementation, and translation. We observed statistically significant decreases in air concentrations of 17 chemicals of concern when participants switched to “green” cleaning products, including decreases in geometric mean concentrations of 1,4-dioxane (-46.4%), chloroform (-86.7%), benzene (-24.8%), naphthalene (-40.3%), toluene (-24.2%), and hexane (-35.5%). We observed significant increases in air concentrations of three fragrance compounds: the plant-derived terpene, beta-myrcene (221.5%), and the synthetic musks celestolide (31.0%) and galaxolide (79.6%). Almost all participants (98%) said the replacement products worked as well as their original products and 90% said that they would consider buying the replacement products in the future. This study demonstrates that choosing cleaning products that are marketed as “green” may reduce exposure to several carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. However, fragrance chemicals continue to be a problem with “green” products and consumers should try to choose fragrance-free. One peer-reviewed paper has been published (Harley et al, EHP 2021) and another is in preparation (Calderon et al, in prep).

We were also very successful in educating community members and empowering local youth. The youth have gained skills in public health research, public speaking, and advocacy as well as creating three short videos showing how to reduce exposure to cleaning chemicals."

Nicotine in THS can be converted to cancer-causing agents during aging.  While little is known about how THS affects human health, data have shown that  it produces changes in cells that could lead to cancer and other adverse health  effects. This research on THS and human health identifies and investigates  effects of the most toxic constituents of THS on cell stress and death in  animal and human cells. The goal is to generate scientific information to inform  the public and officials to create rational policies for the regulation of  indoor smoking and remediation of areas contaminated by THS.  



  Data from our previous  experiments show that THS is characterized by: (1) volatile organic chemicals  that disperse over time and (2) residual chemicals that persist for many  months. Both types of chemicals were cytotoxic, killing cells at higher doses  and inducing stress at non-lethal doses. The goal of the proposed research is  to study cell toxicity of chemicals extracted from fabric samples exposed to  smoke in the laboratory and in fabrics from filed sites including homes and  casinos; measure the amounts of chemicals deposited during various lengths of  time; identity the volatile chemicals that induce cytotoxicity; and study  molecular indicators that THS-exposed cells are stressed and/or dying. This  research will compare results from cultured human cells growing in vitro,  literally “in glass,” and cell and blood samples from THS-exposed mice and  humans. 



  The first Specific Aim will  measure THS toxicity in human cells and then identify the specific molecules  that are targeted by THS. Fabric samples exposed to THS in a laboratory  environmental chamber and collected from homes and casinos will be carpet,  upholstery and drapes, which are likely to act as long-term repositories of THS  chemicals. This Aim will use new assays to measure cellular processes affected  by THS. One assay will examine videos of living cells to observe cell stress,  and use software to detect subtle changes not apparent to human observers. 



  The second Specific Aim will  identify the volatile chemicals in THS-exposed fabrics that cause cytotoxicity  and stress and identify which cell functions are targets of the most potent  chemicals. 



  The third Specific Aim will  measure biological markers in cells that display an adverse reaction to THS in  human fluid/cell samples and animal tissues, and compare these results with  cell data from Aims #1 and 2. Biomarkers of harm include changes in the  expression of genes that result from cell stress and reactions to toxicity. 



  The project will: (1) provide  new quantitative data on cell stress and death caused by THS chemicals  extracted from fabrics exposed in the laboratory and in casinos and homes; (2)  determine which types of fabrics retain the highest concentrations of THS  chemicals and are most harmful to cells, (3) compare THS sensitivity in cells from  embryos and adults, (4) identify the cellular processes and molecular targets  affected by THS; (5) identify specific volatile chemicals in THS that cause  cell death/stress, (6) compare how the concentrations of nicotine and other THS  chemicals in cultured cells compare to actual concentrations in humans and mice  exposed to THS, and (7) determine if biomarkers of harm are elevated similarly  in cultured cells, mice and humans exposed to THS. This is the first study to  compare the toxicity of THS across cell, animal, and human models. Data will  immediately inform regulatory agencies of the types of potential harm from  various fabrics, exposure times, dosages, cell types, cell targets, and stages  of development. The experiments also will accelerate future studies of THS by  validating cell, mouse, and human cell study models and documenting  measurements of THS harmful effects in these different cells.

Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) processes, the long-term goal of this pilot project is to decrease breast cancer mortality through enhanced lay patient navigation that addresses the unique psychosocial needs of VA women with breast cancer. The research team brings together expertise in CBPR, breast cancer navigation programs, mental health and social support, all among VA women. 

Question(s) or hypotheses: The primary research questions for this pilot study are: what are the psychosocial needs of VA women with breast cancer? 

General methodology: We will conduct both quantitative surveys with a convenience sample of 60 VA women with breast cancer to understand the prevalence of specific psychosocial needs, and follow-up qualitative, in-depth interviews with a subset of 15 women to further explore how culture, stigma, and possible intervention efforts may influence their needs. CBPR methods will strengthen our community-university collaborative, inform the tailoring of study surveys and interview guides, and generate intervention ideas for future research development and testing. 

Innovative elements: This pilot CANVAS study is innovative in several ways. First, it is based upon real-world observations and questions by VACF staff about what they can do to understand and address the unique psychosocial needs of their clients. Second, existing research on Asian breast cancer focuses on navigation to breast cancer screening or support for long-term survivorship, and existing breast cancer navigation research focuses on clinic-based models of coordination. Thus, this study fills an important gap in the research literature by focusing on the psychosocial needs of VA women that may be amenable to community-based lay patient navigation services. 

Community involvement: The idea for this study was generated by staff at VACF and further informed by meetings with three VA doctors with significant experience treating breast cancer. They provided important input on the barriers to care among breast cancer patients. Lastly, we met with members of our Community Advisory Board (CAB) (which includes five Vietnamese breast cancer survivors) to review the research questions, methodology and timeline. The Vietnamese community in Orange County will be involved in this pilot project in several ways. Our CAB will actively participate in all aspects of the project implementation, including refinement of the interview guide and survey, training of VACF navigators as project interviewers, participant recruitment, data collection and analyses, intervention ideas development, and community and scientific dissemination. VACF staff will serve as study leaders, interviewers, and data analyzers. The study team also includes a well-known Vietnamese American psychologist who has worked on community mental health, family, community and social issues since 2002. We will seek approval of all study protocols and instruments from both university and community IRBs. 
Future Plans: Based upon the successful completion of this proposed study, we hope to pursue a future research grant to test the efficacy of a novel, culturally appropriate psychosocial intervention for VA ","Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Vietnamese American (VA) women in California, and Orange County has the largest population of Vietnamese Americans in the U.S. This pilot project was initiated by the Vietnamese American Cancer Foundation (VACF) based on their longstanding experiences in community supportive services and their interests in research that is historically-informed, generationally-grounded, and culturally-tailored for Vietnamese American women.

Our findings confirm needs regarding logistical and psychosocial support. Furthermore, CBPR methods strengthened our community-university collaborative, informed the tailoring of study surveys and interview guides, and generated intervention ideas for future research development and testing. Despite significant delays due to COVID, we were able to meet all study aims (with the exception of lower survey completion than hoped). Based upon the completion of this proposed study, we are in the midst of planning for a full CRC grant proposal to test efficacy of a novel, culturally appropriate psychosocial intervention for VA women."

Findings from two Community Health Impacts of Mining Exposure (CHIME) pilot studies found elevated As body burdens in local women compared to what might be expected from national data, higher levels of Cd in long-term residents, and higher body burden and residential soil levels of some metals in women with a history of breast cancer. Data from both studies suggested that body burden levels of As were higher in women who reported routine consumption of produce from home gardens and were active in running and walking on local trails. In a third pilot study we are currently working alongside the community to conduct an extensive and comprehensive exposure assessment to identify potential routes of exposure by identifying environmental hazards in a sample of participants’ home, garden, school and recreational areas.  

The goal of the proposed study is to further pursue the implications of these pilot studies’ findings by taking an expanded look at the pattern of breast cancer incidence throughout the Gold Country region and to collect information on personal and household risk factors that might help explain pilot study findings to date. 

Question(s) or hypotheses: The primary hypotheses of this proposal are 1) Breast cancer incidence is higher in closer proximately to mines sites; 2) Cd and As body burden is associated with environmental exposures through gardening and trail use in areas with mining residue. 
General methodology: The proposed study is an effort to continue active community engagement in an investigation into the health consequences of living in a mining-impacted community. An established and expanded Community Advisory Board (CAB) will guide and oversee all phases of the study. The aims of this study are to assess patterns of breast cancer incidence in Gold Country using geographic information about mines and other land features, as well as socioeconomic factors. We will also conduct an exposure assessment by recruiting and training citizen scientists to estimate residents’ daily exposure to cadmium and arsenic. This project will continue the environmental risk communication and dialogue in the community, disseminate and explain study results, and ultimately generate community guided strategies for exposure reduction. 

Innovative elements: The study will retain three innovative elements of the CHIME pilot studies: 1) CHIME was the first ever CBCRP-funded CRC project to be awarded to a community partner as prime with the academic partner as the sub-contractor, reflecting the project’s genesis within the community; 2) CHIME also broke new ground as the first ever project approved by the scientific partner’s IRB to return individual results to participants, identified by the CAB as critical to the community’s right to know; and 3) CHIME featured citizen science, with a continued view to active participant engagement to conduct further data collection to increase participation in historically underrepresented groups .  In addition, new work with our University of Arizona partner, is developing innovative methods of assessing sources of exposure to the metals of interest to inform potential for remediation and risk reduction. 
Community involvement: This is a project conceived by the community, prompted by concern among local residents about the health effects of their mining legacy in light of efforts to reopen mining operations. In addition, environmental assessments by SSI have revealed widespread heavy metal contamination. The primary aim of CHIME is to establish a community dialogue and involve the community in all aspects of the study. A key element of community engagement is to train participants as citizen scientists to collect environmental data, an approach that is central to SSI’s stewardship model. With 19 years of citizen-generated validated environmental data, SSI will lead the environmental data collection effort by using rigorous protocols and training participants in their use. 

Future Plans: Future research is expected to include epidemiological research on other outcomes related to Cd and As such as child development, birth outcomes, and other cancers. Future studies would also benefit the community by disseminating strategies that minimize exposures and prevent the target metals from entering homes, thereby reducing body burden. The findings of the pilot and of future studies will also be used to support requests for funding of efforts that engage the local community in cleaning up mining’s toxic legacy throughout Gold Country.

MRI is the most sensitive imaging technique for breast cancer detection. However, there are several challenges and concerns involved with MRI screening for breast cancer. MRI screening involves the injection of a contrast agent, and there is a concern that long-term exposure to the contrast agent can have unforeseen side effects. This is especially a concern for high risk women who begin screening at an early age, and then annually thereafter. Contrast also has limited ability to convey diagnostic information about certain types of lesions. These lesions, called non-mass enhancing lesions, make up a significant proportion of cancers diagnosed in women. Additionally, MRI screening with contrast can be so sensitive that it may lead to many biopsies with benign outcomes. This leads to a high number of unnecessary biopsies and stress for the patient. Due to these concerns, researchers are developing new MRI screening techniques, some of which are based on identifying a concerning lesion more accurately without the need to inject contrast, specifically by evaluating the motion of water within cancer cells. This non-contrast approach is called diffusion imaging. To date, these methods have had their own challenges and are used in conjunction with, but not instead of, contrast enhanced MRI screening. We have developed a non-contrast MRI diffusion technique, called Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI), that potentially improves upon prior non-contrast techniques and may serve as a comprehensive method to accurately identify concerning lesions without the need for intravenous contrast. We propose that Restriction Spectrum Imaging may improve upon prior non-contrast diffusion techniques due to its ability to more specifically detect cancer cells as demonstrated in prior brain and prostate applications. In preliminary studies, we have also demonstrated this technique is equivalent to contrast enhanced MRI in evaluating response to chemotherapy in breast cancers. We hypothesize that this technique may be superior to standard diffusion non-contrast imaging on MRI, and adapted as a screening protocol for women at high risk for breast cancer. 
The question(s) or central hypotheses of the research: Goal: Determine an optimal non-contrast MRI protocol for detecting breast cancer for women at high risk for the disease. 
Hypothesis: Restriction Spectrum Imaging (non-contrast technique) will detect breast cancers as well as standard contrast enhanced MRI. 
 The general methodology: Initial development will be performed in a cohort of 60 women, where half the patients will have benign findings and half the patients will have malignant lesions. This cohort will be used for methodology and protocol development in tuning the RSI-MRI technique for breast cancer detection. After the initial protocol is developed on patients with biopsy proven benign or malignant lesions, the protocol will be applied to a cohort of 125 women at high risk for breast cancer. This will allow for initial evaluation of RSI in a high-risk screening population. 
 Innovative elements of the project and potential impact: 
The project will develop a non-contrast MRI technique for breast cancer screening that will increase specificity of MRI for breast cancer, eliminate unknown risks of repeated MRI contrast delivery and unknown consequences of Gadolinium depositing in the brain, and decrease costs of screening breast MRI.","The main goal of this project is to develop an advanced diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique called restricted spectrum imaging (RSI) without an exogenous contrast agent for the evaluation of breast cancer for screening purposes.  For the first step in the project, we developed a model based on imaging data from patients with known biopsy proven breast cancers from 106 patients from two institutes. With this model we characterized signal from different compartments of breast tissue, identifying a model that differentiated large tumors (2 cm at baseline imaging) from the benign breast tissue.  During the course of this grant, we published 3 articles, and presented 7 abstracts.  We currently have four papers under preparation.  In addition to the model development, we improved the distortion correction for breast diffusion. We ended up expanding the first aim and including extensive phantom studies as well as model development.  The second aim of the proposal was to evaluate this model on a screening population.  Data was collected on 180 patients, in an enriched screening population.  Evaluation of this data is still in process with the applied model.  On initial evaluation of the model on screening population, there are many challenges as the size of the malignancies found in the screening population are generally much smaller and thus not detectable with our current protocol.  Our preliminary evaluation on this data set, allowed us to propose a new four year grant that will allow us to tackle the challenges of higher resolution diffusion MRI. Funding and resources from GE healthcare, and RSNA combined with the CBCRP grant allowed for this research to be performed."

This project proposed to achieve the above aim in 4 steps: 1) A rapid review of the literature on alcohol use among young women, breast cancer risk from alcohol, and related health campaigns, to develop initial drafts messaging; 2) Conduct focus groups with young women to assess their opinions and attitudes towards the breast cancer risk in consuming alcohol in general and the draft messaging in particular; 3) Revisions of the messaging based on focus groups findings and in consultation with our Advisory Group, and 4) As part of our Dissemination and Public Engagement Plan, to refine messaging, build a website, disseminate messaging via an email campaign and webinar, and conducting a social media campaign. We successfully accomplished all of our aims, specifically: We produced a rapid narrative review, assembled a six-member Advisory Group with members of various breast cancer advocacy groups and alcohol risk-reduction organizations, conducted 13 online focus groups with women from all over California, built a “Drink Less for Your Breasts” website (drinklessforyourbreasts.org) in English and Spanish, conducted an email campaign to CA-based organizations related to women’s health, held a webinar in April, 2021 and implemented the Drink Less for Your Breasts social media campaign, starting in February 2021. The campaign received national and international press, and was featured in an article in WIRED magazine. We plan to extend this research by working with the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine to conduct a survey among primary healthcare providers to assess awareness of the alcohol – breast cancer link, and supports and barriers to discussing it with their patients, including differences based on the patient’s perceived racial and ethnic group. We will use the findings to prepare a grant to the National Cancer Institute to develop and test active and passive interventions in a diverse primary healthcare setting to improve awareness that alcohol use is a breast cancer risk factor."

Perhaps this is because  today’s standard immune-cell imaging (the nuclear medicine Indium-111 WBC scan)  subjects the patient to far too much radiation for a screening exam. A new  imaging method, Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI), has extraordinary potential to  reveal the patient’s own immune cell homing to early-stage lung cancer, and it  has zero radiation dose. My engineering group at UC Berkeley has designed and  built all the MPI scanners in the USA. In “immunotheranostic MPI”, we will  first pre-label immune cells with safe MPI magnetic tracers, then inject them  into the body intravenously. We will then wait hours (or days) for the immune  cells to home to areas of early lung cancer and then image the entire body in  an MPI scanner. MPI can “see” pre-labeled cells with exquisite sensitivity. We  recently demonstrated 200-cell sensitivity in the world’s first MPI cell  tracking in the lungs, which is 100-fold greater sensitivity than any of our  whole-animal cell tracking methods. We hypothesize that early tobacco-related  lung tumors will be revealed by immunotheranostic MPI with high sensitivity and  specificity because immune surveillance will be intact during the earliest  stages of cancer. As one piece of evidence, Tumor Associated Neutrophils (TANs)  constitute up to 25% of cells from isolated early stage lung tumors. The ACS notes  that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, causing about  1 out of 4 cancer deaths, or about 158,000 deaths annually. The CDC notes  “Cigarette smoking is the number one risk factor for lung cancer. In the United  States, cigarette smoking is linked to about 80% to 90% of lung cancers.”  Early-stage diagnosis is crucial to reduce lung cancer mortality, but, sadly,  this remains very uncommon. The ALA states: “The five-year survival rate for  lung cancer is  54 percent  for cases detected when the disease is  still localized. However, only 15 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at  an early stage. For distant tumors the five-year survival rate is only  4  percent.” Hence, improving imaging methods for early lung cancer diagnosis is  our goal. Since today’s noninvasive imaging methods (MRI and ultrasound) are  ineffective in lungs, Low-Dose CT (LDCT) is used to screen high-risk patients  for lung cancer. The ACS notes that in the National Lung Screening Trial  “people who got LDCT had a 16% lower chance of dying from lung cancer than  those who got chest X-rays.” However, LDCT shows very poor specificity, with  98% of biopsies finding no malignancies. Clearly, we need a better and a less  invasive imaging method for early-stage lung cancer screening. Here we aim to  demonstrate, for the first time, that MPI targeted to the patient’s own immune  cells will provide early diagnosis of tobacco-related lung cancer. Immune cells  are thought to home to early cancers, when the immune surveillance system is still  intact. MPI is a completely noninvasive biomedical imaging modality, relying on  different physics and hardware from MRI, Ultrasound, X-ray and CT. MPI is a  tracer imaging method, like nuclear medicine. My engineering group at UC  Berkeley has designed and built all the MPI scanners in the USA. This year, we  published the first demonstration of MPI cell tracking in lungs, showing  200-cell (200-nM tracer) sensitivity in vivo and also 87-day cell tracking. No  other imaging modality can match this performance in the lungs. Moreover, MPI  will be translatable to human studies since MPI uses zero radiation; safe  magnetic fields; and safe iron oxide nanoparticle tracers. 

","Currently, fewer than 15% of lung cancers are detected at the earliest stage, when treatments are most efficacious.This is the primary reason that lung cancer survival rates are dismal. Screening studies (e.g., low-dose CT) has demonstrate high false positive rates. Ultrasound and MRI are known to fail often in the lungs, due to air-tissue interfaces. In111-WBC or Sestamibi-Tc99m scans could be effective for early-stage lung cancer detection but these are too costly and too high radiation dose to be used in screening studies. Hence, we need a new imaging
method that combines the sensitivity and specificity of Nuclear Medicine without radiation. Here, we are testing the hypothesis that Magnetic Particle Imaging, targeted with Neutrophils, will show sensitive and specific uptake into tobacco-related lung tumors, and thereby enable early-stage lung cancer detection without radiation. Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a new imaging modality that works reliably in the lungs and has outstanding sensitivity (200-cell detection anywhere in the mouse). To specifically target early-stage lung tumors with an IV
injected MPI tracer, we chose to use white blood cells (WBCs, Neutrophils), which are known to target infection, inflammation and cancer with specificity. The immune system surveillance is thought to be active during the early onset of tumors, and the infiltration of granulocytes into lungs have been associated in the early development of tobacco-related lung cancer. Hence, the core idea behind this research effort is to exploit the innate immune system's ability to target early-stage tobacco-associate lung cancer. Here we use a novel, safe, non-radioactive imaging modality, MPI, where the tiny MPI tracers (100-nm diameter) are pre-labeled to the neutrophils. MPI is able to track stem cells with 200 cell detection limits (equivalent to 1 micromolar Fe) and for over a period of three months, and we have shown that MPI stem cell imaging works robustly in lung tissue. For the current reporting period, we performed MPI characterization of labeled WBCs and investigated MPI tracking in mouse model of inflammation. MPI revealed longer retention of labeled macrophages in inflamed mouse lungs."

This is an unexplored  area of research that requires further investigation. In this application, we  propose a unique and innovative study aiming to gain preliminary data on impact  of SHS on epigenetic changes, which has enormous public health relevance. The  studies described in this “Pilot Research Award” application will investigate,  for the first time, the cancer-causing potential of SHS, through epigenetic  mechanisms, in a validated mouse model. Using state-of-the-art technologies, we  will leverage our collection of lung specimens from mice sub-chronically  exposed to SHS smoke and measure reversible and irreversible molecular changes  that are known to be associated with cancer. The completion of the studies  described in this application will help us verify whether the adverse  consequences of SHS exposure are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms and device  strategies for intervention.

","Secondhand smoke (SHS) is a significant public health concern, and a major risk factor for lung cancer and other diseases in nonsmokers. SHS is known to cause DNA damage and mutation in cancer-related genes, however it is unclear whether SHS induces other molecular changes (namely epigenetic changes) that may also lead to cancer development. Epigenetics refers to inheritable alterations that affect the regulation of genes without causing changes in the DNA sequence. These epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in several biological and pathological processes. In this pilot research grant, we have proposed unique and innovative studies aiming to gain preliminary data on the impact of SHS on the epigenetic machinery, which has enormous public health relevance. Using state-of-the-art techniques based on specific antibody-detection assays and Mass-Spec analysis, we have investigated alterations in the level and distribution of epigenetic marks (i.e. 5hmC and histone marks) in mouse cells exposed to SHS relative to untreated controls. The completion of the studies described in this research proposal will help us identify functionally important epigenetic marks that can serve as biomarkers to predict the carcinogenic potential of SHS in nonsmokers."

This creates a sustained disease state throughout the body called  vascular inflammation and causes cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease  is the leading cause of death in the United States, and impacts over 61 million  Americas each year. A properly functioning blood vessel cell has many tightly  regulated proteins sending signals to turn on or off other proteins controlling  different functions of the cell. Smoking has been shown to disrupt this cell  signaling. This proposal examines one such pathway. However, to understand how  this is affected by smoking, first, the mechanisms by which this cell signals  in healthy conditions must be examined. The goal of this proposal is to  understand how activation of a receptor in the blood vessels, specifically the protease-activated  receptor-1 (PAR1), leads to vascular inflammation. We have previously shown the  protein, p38 MAPK is activated by PAR1 and it is well established p38 MAPK is an  important mediator of inflammation. Yet, how PAR1 signals via p38 MAPK to promote  vascular pro-inflammatory responses remains poorly understood. The specific  objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which p38 MAPK  signaling induced by activated PAR1 promotes vascular inflammation. The  proposed studies will determine if PAR1 activation of p38 functions through two  proteins, MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) to promote  inflammatory responses. Both MK2 and HSP27 are shown to be turned on by p38  MAPK and have been shown to influence vascular inflammation. In preliminary  studies, I found that both MK2 and HSP27 are turned on through a p38-dependent  pathway following stimulation of PAR1 in endothelial (blood vessel specific)  cells. The focus of the proposed studies will be to determine how PAR1  stimulated of MK2 and HSP27 regulate vascular inflammation by using both cell  and animal models to assess this question. The contribution of this work is  expected to be significant and will provide new information regarding a novel  signaling pathway in blood vessels that modulates vascular inflammation and new  strategies for targeted-drug development to control vascular inflammation. This  includes, drug targets for the treatment of smoking-induced disruption of blood  vessel signaling pathways mitigating the deleterious effects of sustained  vascular inflammation on blood vessel function. 

","Using TRDRP funding, we were able to define a new pathway that controls the opening and closing of blood vessels and has a potential therapeutic impact for blood vessels that have been damaged from smoking. 

Using the cells in the inner most lining of blood vessels, called the endothelium, we were able to mechanistically map out how the extracellular inflammatory mediator, thrombin, signals through its receptor PAR1 to proteins inside the cell. We found specific amino acids on the protein heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) were activated after thrombin addition and HSP27 is a key regulator of endothelial closing. 

We were also able to show that different activating proteins called kinases had specific activity on specific amino acids on HSP27. Activation of HSP27 by the kinases MK2 and MK3 changes HSP27’s 3D structure and regulates the initiation of closing of the endothelial barrier. These results were confirmed in an animal model that showed that by locking HSP27 in an open state, there was no closure of the endothelial barrier and thus enhanced blood vessel leakage. 

These findings comprise aims 1 and 2 of the proposed research aims and have been published in the prestigious journal of Science Signaling earlier this year. I also had the privilege to present this work at local departmental meetings as well as at national conferences. 

We were also able to develop new methods to test HSP27 3D structure in endothelial cells.  Additionally, we developed new techniques to put HSP27 DNA into endothelial cells and measure electric resistance to determine the impact of different HSP27 amino acids on the endothelial barrier. Unfortunately, we were not able to determine the impact of HSP27 on cytokine productions as proposed in aim 3 due to time constraints and the nature of Aims 1 and 2. While the impact of PAR1 activation of HSP27 signaling is primarily completed, the lab still plans to pursue other signaling pathways activated by thrombin and the PAR1 receptor to modulate blood vessel opening and closings."

COPD  is made up of a number of clinical features including airway inflammation (chronic  bronchitis) in addition to destruction of lung tissue (emphysema). The  processes involved in leading to these clinical manifestations are poorly  understood. We know that inflammation associated with cigarette smoke (CS) is a  contributing factor, however little is known about what drives the chronic  inflammation observed in COPD. Current treatments fail to inhibit this chronic  inflammation activated by CS exposure. Thus, there is a desperate need for new  avenues of investigation aimed at identifying novel regulators of smoke-induced  inflammation. 


We  are interested in studying RNA genes and determining their role in controlling  inflammation. From RNA-sequencing studies we now know that less than 3% of the human genome codes for protein, yet  over 85% is actively transcribed. Why so much RNA is produced and whether it is  all biologically relevant remains a fundamental unsolved problem. Long  noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides  that do not encode proteins, represent the largest group of genes transcribed  from the genome. LncRNAs have emerged as key regulators of biological processes  and we have discovered the first case of a lncRNA that functions to regulate  inflammation in critical immune cells called macrophages. Specifically, we  identified lincRNA-Cox2, as one of the top genes turned on following  inflammation, which functions to regulate critical genes within inflammatory  pathways. 


The  aim of our research is to better understand the basic mechanisms involved in  controlling inflammation within chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This  project is a pilot study to test our hypothesis that lncRNAs function within  the immune system to control inflammation. We are taking two approaches to test  our hypothesis; one is a high throughput approach to study all lncRNAs and  identify those involved in controlling inflammation and the second is a focused  approach to study lincRNA-Cox2 in animal models to determine if it is involved  in COPD disease progression. Completing this project will accelerate our  long-term goal of identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention for  COPD.","The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the genes that contribute to inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We know that COPD includes clinical features such as airway inflammation (chronic bronchitis) in addition to destruction of lung tissue (emphysema). The exact genes and their mechanisms that drive inflammation in COPD are poorly understood. We are particularly focused on a recently identified class of RNA genes called Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). There are 16,000 lncRNAs in the human genome and we only understand the function of less than 3% of these genes. We have data showing that lncRNAs play a role in controlling inflammation and in this project, we are focusing on how they can contribute to controlling inflammation in models of COPD. 
As this project was a new direction of research for the Carpenter lab we spent a lot of the last three years establishing techniques and troubleshooting experimental conditions. We were delighted that within the first year of this project we had established the smoke extract protocol in the lab and were quickly capable of proceeding with the two aims of the project. In addition, we now collaborate with 3 new groups on campus to provide them with smoke extract we generate. 
The first aim of this project was to identify lncRNAs that are dysregulated following smoke exposure in macrophages. We have used two approaches to study this. One is an acute approach where we treat macrophages in culture with 3.5% smoke extract. Our second model is a more chronic model where we perform in vivo experiments on mice that were exposed to smoke or room air controls for 8 weeks. We remove macrophages and for both models we identify the impacted lncRNAs by performing RNA-sequencing of all samples. 
For the second part of Aim1 we performed a high throughput screen allowing us to specifically identify lncRNAs that are functional in controlling inflammation following cigarette smoke exposure in macrophages.
In the second aim of this proposal we investigated the specific role that lincRNA-Cox2 plays in the pathogenesis of COPD. We have performed studies isolating alveolar macrophages from control mice and mice lacking lincRNA-Cox2. We identified a number of cytokines specifically impacted when lincRNA-Cox2 is removed. We analyzed the impact loss of lincRNA-Cox2 had on our in vivo model where control mice and our lincRNA-Cox2 models that had been exposed to smoke or room air (control) for 8 weeks. 
We have written up the results of part of Aim1 and Aim2 as a manuscript and are finalizing edits and plan to submit in the next month. We are currently analyzing the data from our screen and will continue to follow up with hits from this data. We will plan to submit another proposal this year to continue on this exciting work."

Stale  tobacco odor is a recognized problem for residents moving into homes formerly  occupied by smokers, as well as for landlords and realtors. Tobacco residue, also  called thirdhand smoke, contains toxic chemicals and carcinogens. This is  expected as tobacco smoke is known to contain many toxic compounds. A concern  for many affected people is “How can this tobacco residue be removed or  reduced? How risky is this residue?” This research will directly address these  questions. We will investigate whether a commercial cleaning can reduce toxic  chemicals related to tobacco smoke residue in house dust samples from low income  homes. We will measure these samples before and after cleaning. We choose to  focus on house dust samples as children are known to be at risk from toxicants  in contaminated house dust, and well established methods exist for determining exposure  and risks to children. Due to their hand-to-mouth behaviors and short stature,  children ingest much more house dust than adults. In addition, resuspension of  dust near the floor results in breathing in dust, and an increase in skin  contact coupled with a thinner skin relative to adults can lead to significant  skin exposures. Therefore, tobacco residue exposures through house dust can  pose a risk to children. In terms of cleaning up tobacco residue, little is  available to guide cleaning methods and remediation efforts, and no standards  exist to help decide if clean-up has been achieved. Indeed, some of the methods  described on the internet, such as using ozone generators to remove odors,  likely result in secondary formation of toxic products. This study will provide  information on the levels of toxic components of thirdhand smoke and the  effectiveness of commercially available deep cleaning procedures on reducing  thirdhand smoke residue in real home settings. We have already collected these  samples from low income homes in San Diego County. We will measure a wide range  of toxic chemicals in the dust and calculate risks to children from  contaminated house dust both before and after the cleaning was performed. We  hypothesize that levels of these pollutants in dust and on surfaces were  reduced through the cleaning protocols and that risks to children will be  measurably reduced. 

","The potential adverse health effects from thirdhand smoke (THS), the toxic residue that lingers in dust and on surfaces after smoking, are just beginning to be recognized. Young children are particularly vulnerable to thirdhand smoke exposure because of their hand-to-mouth behaviors, developing bodies, and propensity to engage in activity near the floor. To protect children and others, THS-contaminated homes need to be effectively remediated. We completed our first aim by analyzing dust from smokers and nonsmokers homes with nontargeted analysis (NTA)  to discover novel toxic components of THS, using sensitive methods developed in our laboratory, including comprehensive two -dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Of 26 compounds that were more abundant in dust from homes of smokers, seven were tobacco-specific compounds, three of which have never been reported before in house dust. Two compounds, tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (a highly toxic compound used as a flame retardant and reported in tobacco) and propanoic acid, 2-methyl-, 1-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-methyl-1,3-propanediyl ester (highly abundant and reported in exhaled air of smokers), were found in dust from all smokers’ homes and in no non-smokers’ homes, pointing to the power of NTA in discovering novel compounds in THS. For Aim 2, we measured house dust following commercial cleaning in THS-contaminated non-smoker low-income multiunit homes in San Diego, CA. Following cleaning, 34 persistent tobacco-associated compounds were significantly reduced from their baseline (median reduction 75%) as were 41 compounds not related to tobacco. Combination wet and dry cleaning protocols significantly reduced chemical loading, but our findings suggest that most of the reduction was attributable to house dust removal. Our main accomplishments of the research were to identify novel compounds and to highlight dust removal as a method to reduce THS and thus exposure of young children. We plan to continue this work by investigating our suggested markers in dust samples from a wider array of studies,and selecting markers best suited to translation efforts to assess and reduce THS, and thus reduce tobacco use and exposure."

Vaping has  been traditionally thought of as a method of using nicotine (or simply  flavors), but increasingly, many youth are using these devices to vape cannabis  (marijuana). Recent reports suggest that 8-29% of youth have vaped cannabis.  Nevertheless, the public health community is divided regarding whether vaping  poses a threat to the public health of youth. Some argue that youth who vape  are those who otherwise would have used other forms of nicotine or cannabis  (for example, smoking cigarettes or combustible marijuana). Others are  concerned that because youth can vape solutions in different flavors and using  popular high-tech devices, low risk youth who would not otherwise have smoked  may try vaping, and may then progress on to other types of substance use (the  catalyst model of the impact of vaping). Because there still remains relatively  limited research regarding vaping among adolescents and young adults –  particularly of cannabis – it is unclear whether urgent, targeted efforts are  warranted to prevent youth vaping, or what types of messages would be most  effective.


In the current proposal, we aim to  rigorously test the catalyst model to determine whether vaping is recruiting  low-risk youth via appealing characteristics, and whether those who vape are  more likely to progress to other types of substance use. We will leverage an  existing sample with data on vaping both nicotine and cannabis, and will follow  this cohort yearly as they age into early adulthood (ages 18-21). Using digital  surveys, we will collect detailed information of vaping or combustible nicotine  and cannabis use frequency (days used in past 30) and intensity (vaping  episodes per day, puffs per episode, number of joints/cigarettes smoked per  day). We will also add images and video clips depicting different vaping  products to the online survey to identify which particular product features are  predictive of vaping (particularly among low-risk youth) and should be targeted  in regulatory policy. 


Our first aim of the project is to  test hypotheses derived from Step 1 of the catalyst model – to determine  whether and how lower risk populations are being drawn into vaping nicotine and  cannabis. We hypothesize that low-risk adolescents and young adults will be  more likely to vape than to use combustible products. Our second aim is to test  hypotheses derived from Step 2 of the catalyst model – to determine whether and  how AYAs who vape are more vulnerable to other forms of drug use. Specifically,  we hypothesize that vaping nicotine or cannabis may increase the likelihood of:  (i) poly-substance vaping, (ii) combustible cannabis and tobacco product use,  including poly-substance use, (iii) use of other drugs, (iv) nicotine, cannabis,  or other drug dependence. We will further test our hypothesis that these  transitions occur because youth who vape experience rewarding effects from  vaping, and in turn have greater expectancies that other forms of drug use will  similarly engender rewarding effects, thus increasing the likelihood of  experimentation with other substances. 


Addressing these aims collectively  will inform whether and how vaping attracts a broad segment of low-risk youth  and young adults into nicotine and/or cannabis use, leads to regular use, and  adversely impacts the drug use burden in an era when vaping is rampant entry  point into nicotine and cannabis use.

","Vaping—the inhalation of non-combusted aerosolized substances from e-cigarettes and other vaporizers—has increased 10-fold in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) in the past 5 years, nearly doubling in prevalence from 2017-2018. Although vaping has been thought of primarily as a method of nicotine administration, increasingly, AYAs are vaping cannabis plant and oils. The field remains divided regarding whether AYA vaping is a public health problem. Some propose that vaping and smoking are merely manifestations of a common liability to engage in deviant behavior in small group of ‘high-risk’ youth with emotional or behavioral problems, and that the notion of a ‘gateway’ from one substance to another is generated by the media and lacks a sound theoretical basis. Existing data to reconcile this controversy is insufficient. In the current study, we aim to investigate two phases of the catalyst hypothesis, which posits that (phase 1) vaping may draw in low risk youth unlikely to have otherwise used nicotine or cannabis in combusted forms, and (phase 2) that vaping may lead to more adverse patterns of substance use, including poly-substance vaping, combustible product use (including polyuse), initiation of other substance use, and dependence on one or more substances. We aim to further investigate whether product characteristics that may be amenable to regulation influence transitions in either phase.

To address these aims, we used existing data from the Happiness & Health Study – a cohort of youth from whom data were collected every 6 months from 9th to 12th grade (2013-2017). We continued following this cohort through early adulthood. Upon receipt of funds, we began survey development within RedCap – an online survey platform which we are using for data collection now that participants are no longer in school. Our programmers developed a randomization scheme to pilot the unique within-cohort experiment to assess the differential impact of product characteristics through a series of repeated exposures that participants rate. Staff were trained on administering surveys by phone, and in contacting participants to complete the survey online. A variety of recruitment materials were developed – including emails and text messages to contact participants. We have completed all three proposed waves of follow-up data collection. The first wave occurred October 2018-2019 (N=2553, 80.3% retention from prior wave), the second wave May-October 2020 (N=2402, 94.1% retention from prior wave), and the third wave January-June 2021 (N=2167; 84.9% retention from prior wave). Several manuscripts on findings from all three waves of data have been published, and other manuscripts are currently under review, all of which are closely related to the aims of this project. After the conclusion of the project, we intend to continue to follow this cohort (via other funding mechanisms) to further examine factors critically important to evaluating the public health impact of vaping in the AYA population."

This research will assess how e-cigarette  device and e-liquid (liquid used in e-cigarette devices) parameters influence  e-cigarette smoke chemistry, specifically the production of hazardous thermal  degradation products and particle size distribution.  Inhalation toxicology studies will evaluate  how differences in e-cigarette vapor/aerosol characteristics under varying  e-cigarette device and e-liquid parameters influence effects in the respiratory  tract, which will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms by which  e-cigarette smoke may impact the respiratory system in comparison to  conventional cigarette smoke.

","Research over the four years of our TRDRP grant investigated mainstream aerosols from 3rd generation vaping devices, as a function of coil temperature (315 – 510 °F:157 – 266 °C), puff duration (2 – 4 seconds), and the ratio of propylene glycol (PG) to vegetable glycerin (VG) in e-liquid (100:0 – 0:100). Targeted and untargeted analyses were performed using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, gas chromatography, in-situ chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and gravimetry for chemical characterizations. PG and VG were found to be the major constituents (> 99%) in both phases of the aerosol. Most e-cigarette components were observed to be volatile or semi-volatile under the conditions tested. PG was found almost entirely in the gas phase, while VG had a sizable particle component. Nicotine was only observed in the particle phase. The production of aerosol mass and carbonyl degradation products dramatically increased with higher coil temperature and puff duration, but decreased with increasing VG fraction in the e-liquid. An exception is acrolein, which increased with increasing VG. The formation of carbonyls was dominated by the heat-induced dehydration mechanism in the temperature range studied, yet radical reactions also played an important role. The findings from this study identified open questions regarding both pathways. The vaping process consumed PG significantly faster than VG under all tested conditions, suggesting that e-liquids become more enriched in VG and the exposure to acrolein significantly increases as vaping continues. It can be estimated that a 30:70 initial ratio of PG:VG in the e-liquid becomes almost entirely VG when 60-70% of e-liquid remains during the vaping process at 375 °F (191 °C). This work underscores the need for further research on the puffing lifecycle of e-cigarettes.

E-cigarette aerosol and animal studies over the four years of our TRDRP research have been to 1) conduct a complete physical and chemical characterization of the e-cigarette “smoke” generated in the inhalation exposure chamber under varying e-liquid (e-liquid PG/VG base formulation) and power and resistance device settings and 2) perform short-term animal inhalation studies to evaluate the pulmonary effects associated with different device conditions and associated smoke chemistries. Animal inhalation studies have been done in male and female mice to observe biological effects of e-cigarette aerosol inhalation over a period of 10 days of exposure (1, 3, 5 and 10 days), as well as studies performed at low and high temperatures 3rd generation devise operation. These studies have examined histological, inflammatory and gene expression effects of exposure over time and under different operating conditions."

This high rate of  smoking continues even though people with HIV are more susceptible to the  negative effects of tobacco, including greater risk for conditions such as  cancer, as well as cardiovascular and lung diseases. Importantly, smokers  living with HIV (SLWH) say that they are less motivated to quit because smoking  helps them control their emotions and many people in their social networks are  smokers, which could lead to negative social consequences if they did quit. In  contrast, having clear information about the specific effects of smoking in the  context of HIV disease was noted to be a powerful motivator to quit. Given this  background, investigating the social-emotional abilities that support social interaction,  which is known as “social cognition,” in SLWH may identify problems that would  be key areas to target in treatments for quitting smoking to enhance their  success. In support of that idea, one type of social cognition problem, poor  ability to  identify and describe one’s feelings, has been linked to increased tobacco craving.  Problems with other kinds of social cognition, including accurately reading the  emotions and intentions of other people, have yet to be studied in relation to  tobacco craving but have been linked to worse severity of addiction to alcohol  and stimulants, suggesting they may be relevant in tobacco use as well. Also,  both HIV and smoking can affect inflammation, which then contributes to  multiple poor health outcomes. Social-emotional distress is related to higher  inflammation; however, the exact nature of this relationship remains unknown in  SLWH. 


Therefore, this pilot proposal will  examine social cognition in a group of people with and without HIV, half of  whom will be current smokers. Social cognition will be assessed, and it is  hypothesized that SLWH will have worse performance. This poor performance will  be related to increased tobacco craving in the smokers, and this relationship  will be stronger in SLWH. Markers of inflammation and the conditions that  contribute to inflammation will be explored in blood samples. The goal of this  study is to use the knowledge gained to tailor smoking cessation interventions  for SLWH in ways that address their own stated needs.","Higher rates of alexithymia, or difficulty identifying and describing one’s emotions, among people with HIV (PWH) may help to explain their continued elevated smoking rates given that alexithymia is associated with tobacco use and craving. These findings may inform development of a tailored intervention that incorporates psychoeducation and treatment of alexithymia to address the needs and concerns of PWH who wish to quit and remain abstinent. This pilot study aimed to characterize alexithymia and social cognition among smokers living with HIV (SLWH) in comparison to HIV-negative (HIV-) smokers, and both HIV- and HIV+ non-smokers. These aims are intended to help develop treatments addressing emotional and HIV-specific effects of tobacco-related disease among SLWH, which are major themes identified by SLWH in their decision to quit. 

In the second year of the pilot, participant screening and enrollment has continued, with 66 participants enrolled and data-processed.  One barrier that was encountered in our second year was that we were still enrolling participants, with a focus on SLWH, at the time of the university shut-down due to the COVID19 pandemic. Additionally, we are now processing a backlog of assays for this project were not completed prior to the end date of the study due to being in the overall queue of studies at the HNRP. 

Despite these challenges, data showed that smokers have worse emotional and social functioning, which may pose significant barriers to quitting. Smokers have higher alexithymia, which is difficulty understanding and discussing emotions, and a greater likelihood to perceive hostility and rejection from others, as well as significantly more dissatisfaction with their social circumstances. 

We will continue to work toward the following goals: (1) complete biomarker processing, (2) complete data analysis an interpretation for presentation to research, medical, and lay communities."

While  metastasis is the leading-cause of breast cancer-related deaths, there are  still no effective ways of preventing this disease. This is all the more  frustrating since many metastases form months or even several years after initial  surgery or chemotherapy as recurrent disease. While breast cancer subtypes are  useful predictors of the response to therapy they do not adequately identify a  tumor’s metastatic potential. My work on  normal mammary stem cells important for remodeling the breast during pregnancy  led to my recent discovery of a new cancer stem cell (CSC) population  associated with aggressive disease in multiple clinical subtypes. This suggests  that these cells are important biomarkers of breast cancers likely to progress  and potential targets for drug therapy. Importantly, I have identified a key cell  survival pathway that, when reversed, may represent a critical vulnerability of  these CSCs. Thus, my proposal will test the hypothesis that blocking this  pathway represents an Achilles heel for CSCs that will prevent recurrence and  metastasis regardless of breast cancer subtype. If successful, my studies would  represent an important breakthrough toward the goal of reducing deaths from  breast cancer. My approach will incorporate not only more expedient cell lines,  but also state-of-the-art patient-derived tumor models in which to test my  therapies in cancers that better reflect patient disease, including estrogen  receptor-positive (ER+) and triple-negative subtypes. By investigating my  therapy in recurrence models post-chemotherapy, I will go the extra mile in attempting  to prevent metastasis in a setting that mirrors what patients often experience.  Importantly,  I plan to re-purpose pre-existing drugs, already approved for use in patients,  thereby accelerating the potential for translating successful outcomes from  these studies into the clinic. By focusing on eliminating CSCs, my proposed  studies represent a sea change in how breast cancer therapies are identified  and tested in the laboratory. My unique approach may provide a much-needed  means of preventing recurrence and metastasis and reducing mortality in a  broad-spectrum of patient breast cancers. 

","This project focused on reducing mortality from aggressive breast cancers associated with tobacco-use. By identifying new ways of eliminating cancer stem cells we hoped to discover more effective strategies to reduce metastasis, a major cause of breast cancer-related deaths. 

Overall, we successfully completed much of the stated aims. This is particularly true of Aim 1, which resulted in 2 new research articles and a review. While the pandemic was a major obstacle to research productivity, we still managed to make strides toward completing most of Aim 2 as well. Progress on both aims came as a result of overcoming initial barriers posed by recruitment/hiring and training of new team members, characterizing new cell line models of breast cancer metastasis, and the growth and passage of patient-derived tumor models. Major research accomplishments supported by this grant include successful completion of subaim 1.1 and publication of these findings in the journal Cancer Letters entitled ""Combined Bcl-2/Src inhibition synergize to deplete stem-like breast cancer cells"". We also successfully completed subaim 1.2, resulting in a second publication from this project in the nature partnering journal (npj) Breast Cancer entitled “Stem-like breast cancer cells in the activated state resist genetic stress via TGFBI-ZEB1”. Additionally, we presented findings from subaim 1.3 at the AACR Annual Meeting in 2020 as an abstract and poster. Together, results from Aim 1 suggest that targeting key DNA repair and cell survival pathways are promising strategies to deplete stem-like breast cancer cells. Our work in Aim 2 extended these studies in vivo, showing that our cell line model was capable of spontaneous metastasis to both lungs and livers at a high frequency and that the surface marker profile in patient-derived tumors was similar to our cell line models. These findings support the feasibility of using these models for future use to define the contribution of stem-like cells during metastasis. Together, the research findings supported by this grant were successfully leveraged into three new awards totaling $1.5 million over the next three years to support our continued work in this area. In summary, this award allowed us to make great strides toward our goal of discovering more effective therapies to target stemness in aggressive tobacco-related breast cancers."

Past studies have shown that secondhand smoke becomes more toxic as it ages. It is particularly concernful that levels of potent cancer-causing substances (carcinogens) called tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) increase as smoke ages. Studies carried out by this consortium have identified numerous toxic substances in THS, and that many of them persist in homes and other places for long periods after smoking has ceased. This third phase of the Consortium will focus on studies that are ""translational"" in nature, using the information from previous basic science studies, and applying this knowledge to studies that relate more directly to human health issues, and to remediation (detoxification) of THS contaminated homes, automobiles, and other places contaminated by THS. The researchers in this subproject are chemists who have been studying human exposure to toxic substances in tobacco smoke for many years. For this subproject they will continue to develop methods for measuring human exposure to toxic substances in THS, needed to augment those developed in the past. To assist in achieving the goals of the Consortium, they will analyze samples from studies carried out by researchers in other subprojects that will assess the toxicity of THS, and analyze samples from other subprojects to measure human exposure in real-world settings. These studies will expand our knowledge about the chemical nature of THS and its impact on public health. It is expected that the research carried out by this consortium will be useful in developing policies for protecting people from THS exposure, and will help in developing methods for detoxifying places contaminated by THS.","1. Overview. This project is part of the California Consortium on Thirdhand Smoke. Thirdhand smoke (THS) is the residue of secondhand smoke (SHS) that remains on indoor surfaces after smoking ceases. A major goal of the Consortium is to understand the effects of thirdhand smoke on human health. THS contains numerous toxic substances, and measuring exposure to these toxic substances is a necessary step in assessing the potential adverse health effects of THS. This project developed methods for measuring human exposure to THS, and served as a resource for other investigators in the Consortium by analyzing samples from their studies. 

2. Progress. A major aim has been to develop a method to distinguish THS exposure from SHS exposure, which is important because modes of exposure are different: mainly inhalation for SHS, but THS exposure can occur by absorption through the skin or ingestion of house dust by young children. Therefore, strategies for preventing exposure are different. We have demonstrated that the tobacco smoke constituent 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP) has promise for distinguishing SHS exposure from THS exposure. This is important in order to evaluate the relative contributions of SHS and THS to human toxic substance exposure. People may be exposed to either or both: SHS from being around smokers, THS from being in a THS-contaminated home or motor vehicle. As a resource for Consortium investigators, we analyzed numerous samples in support of their studies, including urine biomarkers to assess exposure to THS-derived toxic substances, and samples such as house dust to assess the potential exposure to toxic substances for people living in THS-contaminated homes.

3. Barriers. The major barrier that was overcome during the course of our studies was identifying 3-EP as a promising biomarker. Identifying and developing new biomarkers can be a major challenge.

4. Accomplishments. Major accomplishments were analysis of numerous samples in support of Consortium studies, and progress on development of 3-EP as a biomarker.

5. Future Plans. In the future, with the recently funded Phase 4 of the THS Consortium, we will continue to serve as a resource for the analysis of samples from other Consortium projects."

This disparity is the result of a complex set of biologic and non-biologic factors that include delays in diagnosis and treatment as well as socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. Community-identified and community-driven approaches to address this disparity that can be easily implemented and scaled are urgently needed. A community-university partnership between Black Ladies Advocating for Cancer Care (BLACC) Peer Navigators and the Stanford Office of Community Engagement has come together to address this disparity by focusing on peer navigation for African American women. Peer navigation has been identified as a promising strategy to address breast cancer disparities and improve outcomes by addressing barriers to quality cancer care and providing comprehensive social support. Several critical gaps in research limit the implementation of peer navigation to address disparities faced by African American women. First, peer navigation programs that have been tested vary widely in terms of who serves as peer navigators, how they are trained, and what services are provided. Second, there have been very few peer navigation programs that were developed by and for African American women. Third, research designs have been limited to primarily retrospective and observational approaches as opposed to more rigorous designs such as randomized controlled trials. This project will address these research gaps through 3 aims. First, we will use a community-based participatory research orientation to strengthen and sustain a community-university partnership focused on improving breast cancer outcomes among African American women in California. Second, we will use storytelling with breast cancer survivors to examine the clinical and non-clinical needs and assets of African American women during the breast cancer peri-diagnostic period. Third, using data from breast cancer survivors and models of existing peer navigation programs, we will co-create a peer navigation program for the peri-diagnostic period for African American women.","Throughout the course of our pilot award our community-university partnership, BLACC (Black Ladies Advocating for Cancer Care) Peer Navigators and the Stanford Office of Community Engagement (OCE) has successfully completed our goals of 1) strengthening an existing community-university partnership in order to support community-based participatory research addressing Black/African American women experiencing breast cancer disparities; and 2) co-creating an effective peer navigation program for Black/African American women going through breast cancer treatment.

Chemotherapy is used for the treatment of patients with metastatic TNBC. However, patients often develop resistance to chemotherapies and recurrence of cancer is common after initial response. Hence, there is an urgent need for improved therapies. We believe that an optimal therapeutic should not only eradicate tumors but also prevent tumor recurrence. Immunotherapy has shown unprecedented long-lasting efficacy in several types of malignancies. Therefore, we propose to study a novel therapeutic approach called “viro-immunotherapy”, which is a combination of two novel therapeutic approaches: Oncolytic virotherapy and Immunotherapy. Oncolytic viruses are live viruses “tamed” to replicate in and kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed. We have generated an artificial oncolytic poxvirus (CF33) that is very potent in killing breast cancer cells. This virus can further be armed with immune-stimulatory genes to act as immunotherapy for better treatment ofTNBC. 

Central hypotheses: We hypothesize that a chimeric poxvirus (CF33) can be engineered to selectively replicate in and kill triple negative breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the virus can be modified to produce two immune-stimulatory proteins, LIGHT and IL-15, which can further increase anti-tumor effectiveness of the virus by provoking anti-tumor immune response. Finally, virally produced immune-stimulatory proteins will prevent the cancer from recurrence by long-term maintenance of cancer-specific memory immune cells. The general methodology: We have already created a potent oncolytic poxvirus (CF33) that can kill triple negative breast cancer cells. We have also armed this virus with the immune-stimulatory genes LIGHT and IL-15 (CF33-LIGHT-IL-15). We will explore safety and anti-tumor efficacy of CF33-LIGHT-IL-15 in mouse models. Innovative elements and potential impacts: The main innovation of this project is the development of a next-generation immuno-oncolytic virus that combines the direct cancer killing ability of a chimeric poxvirus with enhancement of anti-tumor immunity through immune-stimulatory proteins produced by the virus. Our innovative project has the potential of developing a novel therapeutic for improved treatment, with less resistance and recurrence, ofTNBC.","Our working hypothesis was that an oncolytic poxvirus (CF33) modified to make 2 immune-stimulatory proteins (mLIGHT and interleukin-15 or IL-15), could specifically kill cancer cells and optimally activate immune system to eliminate cancer. We first inserted the gene for mLIGHT protein in the CF33 to make CF33-mLIGHT. The next step was to insert gene for IL-15 in this virus to  get the doubly-armed virus (CF33-mLIGHT-sIL15). However, it was challenging to insert the gene for IL-15 in CF33-LIGHT to get the doubly-armed virus (CF33-mLIGHT-sIL15). Therefore, for initial studies we decided to study the efficacy of the singly-armed viruses (CF33-mLIGHT and CF33-sL15) in combination. In the murine TNBC model (E0771), the combination treatment significantly increased survival of tumor bearing mice, however, the anti-tumor efficacy in terms of tumor regression was only moderate. The viruses were more potent against TNBC tumors of human origin in immune-compromised mice. 

After trying different strategies of virus construction, we were able to finally construct the doubly-armed virus (CF33-mLIGHT-sIL15). After construction of this virus, we first confirmed the ability of this virus to produce the immune-modulatory proteins (mLIGHT and IL-15) in cultured cancer cells. Next, we tested the anti-tumor efficacy of this virus in the mouse TNBC model (E0771). Because immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 have shown impressive therapeutic efficacy in many tumor types, we also combined our oncolytic viruses with anti-PD-1 to study their combined therapeutic efficacy. While the virus as a single therapeutic agent showed minimal therapeutic advantage, combination of anti-PD1 with the doubly-armed virus (CF33-mLIGHT-sIL15) showed the highest therapeutic efficacy with complete tumor regression in 4 out of 9 treated mice. Our study suggest that this virus may work well in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. In future, we plan to test our virus in combination with PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors in different models of TNBC."

Immunotherapy directs our own immune system to attack cancer cells, versus traditional cancer drugs that target the cancer cells directly. However, to date, responses to immunotherapy in patients with breast cancer have been limited compared to other cancers such as melanoma. One reason for this lack of success is that the immune cells that are trying to attack the cancer cells are being inhibited. This inhibition is due in part to depletion of nutrients that feed the immune cells and allow them to function. Two of these nutrients are the amino acids cysteine and arginine. The goal of this project is to show that reversing the depletion of these nutrients by disrupting their metabolism will increase the success of immunotherapy in breast cancer.  

We will treat mice that have breast cancer with immunotherapy that has been previously shown to have limited benefit in this model. Some mice will receive immunotherapy along with the drug Viagra, which blocks arginine metabolism. Other mice will receive immunotherapy along with agents that block cysteine metabolism. The effectiveness of treatments will be measured based on whether the mice that get nutrient metabolism-targeted agents show increased tumor shrinkage compared to mice that receive immunotherapy alone. Additionally, we will study the immune cells in these tumors to understand how they change in response to therapy.

Our proposal is innovative and significant because it provides a novel strategy to treat breast cancer by combining immunotherapy with agents that reverse nutrient depletion in and around the tumor. Viagra is currently in clinical trials to help treat other types of cancers, which will speed up the translation of our findings with this agent to use in the clinic for patients with breast cancer. A demonstration that our strategies targeting cysteine metabolism can enhance immunotherapy will provide critical data to support further studies to refine these agents into actual therapeutics. The impact of these studies will be novel combination immunotherapies that fulfill the potential of this powerful new class of therapy so patients with breast cancer can enjoy the benefits of immunotherapy that patients with other types of cancer have started to benefit from.","Overview:  Responses to immunotherapy in patients with breast cancer have been limited compared to other cancers such as melanoma. One reason for this lack of success is that the immune cells that are trying to attack the cancer cells are being inhibited. This inhibition is due in part to depletion of nutrients that feed the immune cells and allow them to function. Two of these nutrients are the amino acids cysteine and arginine. The goal of this project was to show that reversing the depletion of these nutrients by disrupting their metabolism will increase the success of immunotherapy in breast cancer.  
Progress towards completion of aims:  Our first aim was to test the ability of Sildenafil (Viagra), which blocks arginine metabolism, to enhance immunotherapy in the 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer.  We demonstrated that Sildenafil alone had no direct anti-cancer effects on 4T1 cell growth in cell culture or in mice and while immunotherapy alone resulted in tumor growth inhibition the addition of Sildenafil only slightly improved this effect.  Our second aim was to determine if altering cysteine metabolism by targeting the cysteine transporter molecule xCT could enhance breast cancer immunotherapy.  We were unable to reproduce earlier findings that the nanobody p231 could block xCT activity.  We also tested a variety of xCT antisense oligonucleotides (agents that target the xCT RNA and modulate xCT protein expression).  Although we were able to demonstrate significant uptake of these agents into 4T1 cells in culture, they failed to reduce xCT protein levels in these cells.
Barriers:  Due to the COVID personnel density restrictions in the lab, ongoing supply delivery problems started during the UCSF COVID slowdown, and unexpected problems we had with growing the mouse breast cancer cells to be used in this study, our work got off to a slow start.  We overcame the cell culture barrier by tested several different batches of one culture component, fetal bovine serum, to get good cell growth with the correct morphology, and enough cells to use for in vivo experiments.  
Plans for future work:  While the anti-xCT nanobody p231 failed to reproducibly block xCT activity, we have a large panel of nanobodies from the initial screen that we will continue to characterize for xCT functional inhibition and expect to eventually identify and refine these in the near future.  Similarly, we have established efficient transfection conditions for delivering antisense oligonucleotides into 4T1 cells and will continue to test other xCT targeted sequences."

BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for at least half of inherited breast cancer. Mutations on BRCA1 predispose women to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive breast cancer subtype with a 12% 5-year survival rate when TNBC spreads to other parts of the body.  
Prophylactic mastectomy while effective to reduce breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 patients, poses significant psychological side effects and impairs the life quality of BRCA1 carriers. A noninvasive method is urgently needed for breast cancer early detection and/or prevention in BRCA1 carriers. An essential step is to understand how the normal breast epithelial cells become pre-neoplastic lesions and later tumor cells in BRCA1 patients. 

Human breast epithelium is organized as a bilayer with a basal layer of myoepithelial cells and luminal epithelial layer surrounding the mammary lumen. Early work demonstrated that the long-lived luminal epithelial cells or luminal progenitors are the cellular origin of BRCA1-associated breast cancer. However, only a small subset of luminal progenitors responds to BRCA1 loss and become aberrantly differentiated. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the cellular origin of BRCA1 breast cancer and to dissect the mechanism(s) to control the transition from normal breast epithelial cells to pre-neoplastic lesions and tumor cells. Our preliminary data thus far identified a novel marker in the BRCA1-deficient luminal progenitors. We hypothesize that this unique luminal progenitor cells are the cellular origin of BRCA1 breast cancer. 

To test this hypothesis, we will use a mouse model to specifically deplete BRCA1 in aberrant luminal progenitors while simultaneously labeling the cells with red fluorescent protein to follow the BRCA1 deficient cells. Using the single cell gene expression profile technology, we will track the development of the red normal cells to red pre-neoplastic lesions and red tumor cells. This analysis will provide key insights into the mechanism(s) of pre-neoplastic lesion formation, one of earliest stage of breast cancer. This work, if successfully completed will provide novel biomarkers for early detection and/or prevention such work can directly benefit BRCA1-mutated patients.","BRCA1 mutations significantly increase the risk to develop breast cancer by almost 7-fold higher and luminal progenitors in breast epithelium have been shown as the cellular origin of BRCA1-associated breast cancer. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms to transform the luminal progenitors in BRCA1 deficient cells will help to identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities in BRCA1-deficient luminal progenitors for early detection and intervention. Our previous work found that the DNA damage from BRCA1 loss promotes the transdifferentiation as a critical step toward triple negative breast cancer. We aim to generate novel mouse models to study BRCA1-related breast cancer development. 

Clusterin(Clusterin) is a novel marker for regenerative stem cells after DNA damage in small intestine and our preliminary data found that: 1) Clu is overexpressed in the BRCA1-deficient luminal progenitor cells; 2) and DNA damage in luminal breast cancer cells MCF7 can induce CLU expression. In this proposal, we plan to specifically deplete BRCA1 in the Clusterin-expressing luminal progenitor cells by generating the BRCA1fl/fl; Rosa26tdTomato; Clu-CreERT2; P53-/- mouse model. After receiving the approved animal protocol, we requested and received the Rosa26tdTomato; Clu-CreERT2 mouse model and purchased the BRCA1fl/fl; P53+/- mice from Jax lab. However, the original Rosa26tdTomato; Clu-CreERT2 mouse model contains other genetic mutations (YAP) and required several rounds of mouse breading to eliminate the mutations.  Repeated outbreak of COVID19 in 2021-2022 led to several months shutdown and restricted access to the mouse facility and campus. Our work progress is significantly delayed by these unpredictable factors.   

Despite these obstacles, we have made a significant progress during this funding period to understand the mechanism by which BRCA1 suppress breast cancer. First, we used the CRISPR/CAS9 to knockout CLU in MCF7 cells as the stable cells. We also generated a lentivirus plasmid to stably express CLU in MCF7 cells to study the function of CLU in breast cancer cells.  Our data found that either CLU loss or CLU overexpression has little effect on the sensitivity to DNA damage agent cisplatin. This suggests CLU is a not DNA repair factor in breast cancer cells. We also attempted to inject the cisplatin into the mammary glands in Rosa26tdTomato; Clu-CreERT2 mice and found no difference on CLU positive cells. These data suggest CLU is a regeneration stem cell marker for small intestine but not for the mammary gland. To further investigate other factors to contribute to the BRCA1-dependent tumorigenesis, we identified a novel BRCA1 associated protein METTL3 (Methlytransferase 3) and generated a knockin mouse model for METTL3. We will continue to understand the genetic and biochemic mechanism of the BRCA1-METTL3 complex in breast cancer."

Chemical contaminants detected throughout the neighborhood and deemed carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls, some of which have been detected in groundwater. Exposure to endocrine disrupting pollutants has been found to increase the risk of breast cancer. As EDCs are persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is important to assess the longer-term impacts of EDC exposures across generations. In San Francisco, Black/African American women experience the greatest disparities in breast cancer-related outcomes. Compared to other neighborhoods in San Francisco, women from BVHP were more likely to be diagnosed with more aggressive breast tumors with a faster growth rate, and overall higher breast cancer mortality rates.  BVHP residents have the shortest life expectancy in the San Francisco area, well below California's average life expectancy of 82 years.  A decades-long history of systemic racism and multiple environmental contaminants, combined with ineffective assessments, poor clean-up, and untrustworthy behavior by institutions, has contributed to BVHP community concerns about the potential link between exposure to toxic contaminants and cancers and frustration over a lack of reliable scientific information about risk, accountability and transparency of government and industry polluters to clean up known toxins, and the need for greater community engagement and oversight. The goals of this pilot project are to address the organizational and research issues necessary for creating an intervention strategy that would provide women living in the BVHP with the training and support – the Health Equity Advocates and Leaders in Environmental Research and Science (HEALERS) program - to educate and activate the community about the prevention of harmful environmental exposures and advocate for policies that protect health and decrease incidence of breast cancer.","The goals of this pilot project were to address the organizational and research infrastructure necessary for developing an intervention strategy to train and support women living in Bayview Hunters Point (BVHP) for advocacy and leadership.

The study will examine the knowledge, behaviors, and practices of Latinas who are educated by Promotoras.  Through peer-to-peer learning, Latinas will learn about actions that individuals, families, and communities can take to lower their exposure to toxins. The main focus will be on the behaviors that can be changed  as a result of this training as the Latinas within this study population cannot control all environmental exposures they may be in contact with in their workplace or at home. Latinas will have a chance to use a text-based app program that will provide additional educational materials and resources, apart from what they learned from the Promotoras.  We hope to include 20 promotoras who each deliver a training to two groups of 8-10 Latinas within their communities. Therefore, we believe a total of 180-200 participants will be included in the study. We will discover the impact of the promotora training program in three main areas: if the Latinas trained in the program learn new information about hidden hazards and how to reduce and eliminate their exposures, if Latinas feel confident in adjusting  their behaviors to lessen their contact with dangerous chemicals, and if indeed they change any behaviors or actions to lower their contact with environmental toxins.  We will give the Latinas a survey before and after they are educated by the Promotoras to collect information about what they knew before learning from the Promotoras, as well as what they found out about because of the program. We will also ask survey questions about their backgrounds, so that we know information about  who the  Latinas are that received the educational training from Promotoras.  Furthermore,  three weeks and three months after the program,  we will ask the Latinas more questions about  any changes they made in lowering their contact  to environmental hazards.",

These approaches look for novel exposures in nurses very broadly without deciding in advance which chemicals to target. The project responds to nurse collaborators’ concerns about hazardous work exposures. We propose to measure nurses’ exposure to disinfectants, drugs, PFAS, and other breast cancer-relevant chemicals; to integrate biomonitoring and workplace air monitoring through a silicone wristband; and to discover associations between exposures and early biological effects that we measure in their blood. We have four specific aims: Aim 1: Collect blood, urine, and silicone wristband passive air monitors from 60 nurses and 40 office workers. Measure chemicals of interest using targeted and non-targeted approaches. Aims 2 and 3: Compare exposures between nurses and office workers and identify correlated exposures between wristbands and blood. Aim 4: Identify changes in blood that are associated with chemical exposures and determine affected biological pathways relevant to breast cancer.
We hypothesize that we will detect drugs, disinfectants, PFAS and other breast cancer-relevant exposures in wristbands or blood, that nurses will have some unique exposures, and that some chemical exposures will be associated with biological changes in blood. This project advances a critical path to breast cancer prevention by applying new methods for measuring exposures to breast cancer-relevant chemicals and associated early biological changes. Measuring these associations provides insights into biological pathways for breast cancer-relevant chemicals and supports efforts to reduce exposures. By studying nurses, we may uncover potential sources of higher breast cancer risk in this group. Our partnership of researchers, advocates, and nurses ensures our questions are relevant to what exposed communities care about and produces the science needed to strengthen public health protections. It is the basis for translating our findings into policy changes that reduce exposures and associated risks. The work enhances the WWBC sample archive, creating a valuable resource for further study.","This Women Workers Biomonitoring Collaborative study aims to recruit 60 nurses (UCSF) and 40 office workers (City of SF) to provide blood and urine samples and silicone wristband passive air monitors.

Our partnership of researchers, advocates, nurses ensures our questions produce the science needed to strengthen public health protections and advance policy changes that reduce exposures and associated risks.

Together with our community partners, we have made significant progress towards our recruitment and sample collection protocols, despite receiving funds several months into the award. We co-developed and submitted our IRB protocol which was approved, and expect to begin recruitment as well as sample and data collection in July 2024, which will then continue over the next 6-8 months. We developed a relationship with new partners at the City and County of San Francisco in the Health Service System, who have championed this project and acquired departmental support to facilitate recruitment of municipal office workers for our study. We also identified and hired a mobile phlebotomist with significant experience working on biomonitoring studies through Biomonitoring California and who will contribute to our sample collection efforts. We collaboratively developed sample collection plans that respond to the unique needs of nurses and office workers and their schedules. We are currently finalizing recruitment materials and sample collection plans which we developed in collaboration with our nurse and office worker community partners.

We propose to expand this work to screen thousands of chemicals in grandmothers and grandfathers’ blood collected at the time of pregnancy for correlations with a new breast cancer biomarker in daughters and granddaughters (DNA methylation, DNAm, which controls how genes function).

Research Questions
1) Which DNAm patterns in daughters and granddaughters correlate with their age at menarche and obesity?
2) Do these informative DNAm patterns overlap in daughters and granddaughters?
3) Are these or other DNAm patterns correlated with grandmother and/or grandfather exposures?
4) Are grandparents’ exposures different or greater  in families of Black women and linked to DNAm patterns for aggressive breast cancer?

Methods
Through other funding, we measured thousands of environmental chemicals in  grandfathers’ and grandmothers’ blood with the new technology, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRM) in the 3-Generations Breast Cancer study, a subset of the CHDS. We will add measures of DNAm in 100 daughter-granddaughter pairs (200 women) to discover links between grandmothers’ and grandfathers’ exposures to their daughters’ and granddaughters’ age at menarche, obesity and DNAm.

Innovation and Impact
We will find new environmental chemicals that correlate with breast cancer risk across 3 generations. The new chemical risk factors we discover will be relevant to chemicals currently in our environment. Very few of the thousands of chemicals present in the 1960’s have been banned and some are now accumulating in our bodies. Findings about grandfathers will be unique and will inform prevention messages for young men on how fathers contribute to breast cancer risk. Novel DNAm biomarkers will expand scientific knowledge on how transfer of risk over generations happens and will support prevention efforts that reach young people. Results specific to Black women will result in relevant prevention messages for Black women. Findings will lead to new opportunities for breast cancer prevention via policy, individual choices, and potentially, via repair of damaged DNAm.","1) We will discover the father’s contribution to transmission of breast cancer risk over three generations and to higher risk for aggressive breast cancer breast cancer in Black women. 2) Aim 1: We chose 115 daughter-granddaughter pairs with essential data on age at menarche and obesity. We created a lab ID and randomized batches to ensure labs are blinded to subject information that could bias the study. Blood samples for epigenome measurement (DNA marks that control DNA function) were ordered from the Berkeley Public Health Biorepository and be shipped to University of California, Davis for epigenome measurement as planned. Aim 2: We completed and presented preliminary analyses at the Gordon Research Conference on Endocrine Disruptors (Power point is in Appendix) on the relation of grandfather’s contribution to daughter and granddaughter age at menarche and obesity. Aim 3:We met with our community partner to outline likely themes and technical plan for the dissemination campaign. 3) We successfully negotiated que at the biorepository and were able to help the biorepository locate samples that were misplaced there. We reconciled existing data on the metabolome (internal chemistry in a person’s blood that measures responses to the environment) to ensure integrity of the data analyses. 4) We presented the first ever report of grandfather’s contribution to breast cancer risk in daughters and granddaughters. Highlights- --Grandmother’s  and grandfather’s  blood at the time of pregnancy show metabolome pathways linked their daughter’s and granddaughter’s obesity and age at menarche. ---There is a clear contribution to age at menarche from the grandfather (paternal line), which is stronger for granddaughters than daughters. ---Bile acids and steroid hormones in grandparent’s blood at the time of pregnancy are consistently associated with daughter and granddaughter age at menarche, suggesting a role for liver function.--Bile acids were also linked to the first preliminary analysis of environmental exposures in grandparents’ blood at the time of pregnancy narrowing interpretation to a possible mechanism for transmission of risk. 5) Plans: Refine preliminary analyses, complete epigenome assays, add the epigenome assays to data analysis, examine race specific results."

Many environmental chemicals could transmit breast cancer risk from mother to daughter during the mother’s pregnancy. Stress may magnify the consequences of exposures in the womb. 
Research Questions. 1) Are there patterns in our DNA in midlife (DNA methylation, DNAm, which impact how genes are regulated) that signify exposure to environmental chemicals in the womb? 2) Do DNAm signals reflect changes in biological pathways that lead to breast cancer? 3) Do Black women have more or different exposures in the womb and are the consequences worse because of neighborhood stressors, experiences of discrimination, and resulting cumulative life stress? 3) Are there environmental chemical exposures in midlife that magnify effects of exposures in the womb and are these more intense in Black women? 
Research Methods. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRM) is a new technology to measure thousands of chemicals in blood. So, it is now possible to find chemicals in mothers’ pregnancy blood that link to daughters’ breast cancer that no one suspected before. Through other funding, we are completing HRM in mothers’ pregnancy blood and in daughters’ midlife blood in a 2-generation study of Alzheimer’s disease in the Child Health and Development Studies pregnancy cohort. Here we propose to add measures of DNAm in daughters’ blood samples that were previously collected in midlife. Then we will link exposures in the womb to our existing data on neighborhood stressors, age at menarche, obesity, lifetime stress and to the new DNAm measures. The study sample has an equal number of Black and white women creating a rare opportunity for a two-generation study that includes existing measures of exposures in the womb and midlife combined with information on neighborhood and cumulative lifetime stress. 
Innovation and Impact. We will find new environmental chemicals that could transmit breast cancer risk from mother to daughter during the mother’s pregnancy, learn whether these are higher in Black women, whether neighborhood, lifetime stress and exposures in midlife magnify risk from exposures in the womb. This new evidence will support ways to intervene early in life to reduce inequities over generations and may reveal some midlife strategies. We will provide this information to women and decision makers to reduce inequities in risk of fatal breast cancer for Black women.","1)Add midlife epigenome (DNA marks that control DNA function) to our Disparities Study, to understand how environmental chemical  exposures in utero, midlife, individual and neighborhood stressors together contribute to breast cancer disparities. 2) Aim 1: Ordered and shipped blood samples for 174 female Disparities participants to Dr. Jason Richardson (University of Georgia) for DNA extraction.  Aim 2: Preliminary analyses on the relation of neighborhood and individual stressors to individual prenatal exposures. Aim 3: Collaborated with Community PI to prepare the first blogs to reach young Black women. 3) By extracting DNA needed both for our NIH funded Alzheimer’s study and for this CBCRP grant (Dr. Richardson) we saved samples from an unnecessary thaw. 4) Pregnant women in the 1960’s who lived in neighborhoods characterized by disadvantage (high concentration of: Black persons, or lower income persons, or  lower education or a combination of lower income and Black persons) had higher levels of DDTs in their blood, a  risk factor for breast cancer in mothers and their daughters. However, there was no correlation of neighborhood with PCBs (industrial chemicals).  Findings are consistent with migration of Black families to the Oakland area from the south and agricultural areas where DDT was heavily used. These findings uniquely document the relation of individual chemical exposures to neighborhood and individual stressors such as race. This is important because it opens the discussion to include disparities in environmental exposures as an explanation of more aggressive breast cancer in Black women. 5) Plans: Dr. Richardson will send extracted DNA to University of California, Davis to measure the midlife epigenome. Samples will be randomized into batches and labs will be blinded to all subject information other than the lab ID. We will complete measures of epigenome at midlife and add these data for integrated analysis of on in utero, midlife chemical exposures, neighborhood  and individual stressors to understand causes of aggressive breast cancer in Black women and ways to reduce this disparity."

For Aim 1A, we completed the recruitment of the last participants this past week and  fulfilled the task of recruiting 80 participants We processed about 70% of the wristband samples collected in our laboratory. We completed the administration of all the questionnaires about breast cancer as proposed in Aim 2A. We completed the qualitative assessment Aim 2B.
3)	We have not encountered any major barriers, besides a delay in the access to funds and approval of IRB, which slowed down our training of promotoras along with recruitment.
4)	Some of the major accomplishments include a. completing the recruitment of all participants as proposed in Aim 1A; b. processing about 70% of the collected samples in our laboratory; c. Completing the administration surveys on knowledge/attitudes surrounding breast cancer to all 80 participants Aim 2A); d. completing all key informant qualitative interviews to 25 participants (100% completion of Aim 2B).
5)	We requested an NCE of 6 months to complete the pending tasks. We plan to finalize the processing of samples and complete the laboratory assessment by April. Prepare and disseminate results in June/July. The novelty in the expected results of using a non-targeted analysis along with a toxicological assessment will allow us to pursue additional funding."

Hispanic individuals, particularly Spanish speaking breast cancer (BC) survivors living in rural regions, often experience additional challenges such as, travel distance. However rural Hispanic BC survivors underutilize resources due to lack of knowledge about community resources, insufficient patient referrals for services, and language barriers. Financial challenges increase the likelihood of delays in seeking treatment, poor quality of life, and early death. This community-academic research partnership between the Kern County Cancer Foundation (KCCF) and San Diego State University (SDSU), collaborating with community stakeholders and key informants, aims to identify and document community assets to address these challenges and elicit resource mobilization strategies in Kern County, a rural and underserved region.  
Questions: 1. What types of assets are available in the community? 2. What are the best approaches to mobilize resources in the community?  
General methodology: First, we will conduct 3 focus groups (8 people in each group) with two groups of Hispanic BC survivors and family members (each group by language: English, Spanish) and one group of health care professionals from the local organizations/institutions and key informants (e.g., community leader). The total sample size will be 24. Second, based on the information obtained from the focus groups and internet (e.g., findhelp.org), we will create asset inventories and then create visual asset mapping. We will also discuss the strategies to mobilize resources in the community. Content analysis will be used to analyze the data. 
Innovation and potential impact: This pilot project is innovative in that first, as a community-based participatory research (CBPR) project, it maximizes participants’ voices and input of the community throughout the research process. Second, despite system issues, information on the systems level approach to improve access/mobilization of financial resources is limited. Hence, this proposed CBPR project will expand our knowledge about the tangible/intangible community assets, best approaches to mobilize them, and opportunities to build community capacity.","This project employed community-based participatory research (CBPR) to address two principal objectives: 1) the identification and visualization of asset mapping, particularly concerning financial resources and 2) the expansion and reinforcement of community partnerships aimed at achieving systemic change in Kern County, a rural and underserved region.

The project successfully fulfilled its objectives by: 1) completing asset inventories, which resulted in the development of a Google Map of the financial resources in Kern County; 2) conducting focus groups with key informants and stakeholders, including Latina breast cancer patients, their family members, and community leaders, to evaluate resource mobilization strategies; and 3) enhancing partnerships with community organizations by identifying key leaders and strengthening these collaborative efforts. The themes that emerged from the focus groups revealed several barriers faced by Latina breast cancer patients in accessing resources, including: a) insufficient information dissemination, b) a lack of outreach personnel in rural communities, and c) cultural challenges such as feelings of shame and the prevailing norm of ""being strong."" Mitigating strategies the participants suggested were: 1) targeted outreach in rural areas and 2) establishing partnerships with community leaders. Throughout the execution of this project, we also successfully identified key community leaders and engaged in coalition-building activities. We encountered no significant barriers in the completion of this project. Although there were initial concerns regarding participation in the focus groups due to their scheduling in the evening, we achieved commendable community engagement, with 32 participants, surpassing the target of 24.

Based on our findings, we intend to investigate the effects of coalition building on reducing health disparities, particularly in relation to the access and utilization of financial resources among Latina breast cancer patients, with potential funding from CBCRP, NIH, or the William T. Grant Foundation. The results from our planning grant and preliminary studies highlighted the deficiency in partnerships among community organizations, which has led to fragmented service referrals for patients. This situation underscores the necessity of strengthening networks within the community, particularly in rural areas."

It can function in communities by restricting access to benefits (e.g., quality education, housing, healthcare) or by exposure of residents to more incarceration or air pollution. Due to its broad impact on conditions that hinder good health, structural racism is a fundamental cause of poor health among racial minority groups. It has been linked to later breast cancer stage at diagnosis and worse survival for Black females. Oakland, California has historically been a location of segregation and structural racism for African Americans. More recently, most areas of Oakland have undergone gentrification and displacement of African American residents. Deep East Oakland remains the last community that is home to many long-time African American residents, but it is now at risk for resident displacement. Our work will be grounded in the people of East Oakland to support the community’s objectives to counter its history of structural discrimination and the threat of gentrification and displacement of residents. Through this proposed planning project, we aim to partner with the 40x40 initiative and the People’s Advisory Council in East Oakland. The 40x40 initiative is a coalition community organizations, African American leaders, residents, and businesses. A key aspect is the People’s Advisory Council comprised of community members and 40x40 representatives. Our study team will partner with the council to design a community-based research study that addresses a community need. First, we will partner with the People’s Advisory Council to identify one or more areas of structural need within East Oakland that aligns with our team’s expertise. Second, we will design an adaptation of a mobile mapping platform (Streetwyze) so that we can collect crowd-sourced data from East Oakland residents to assure broad applicability of an intervention in the community. Our third aim is to develop a proposal to design, implement, and test an intervention targeting that area of need. We hope our work will provide East Oakland with additional knowledge, tools, and connections to protect and build their community to support the health of its residents, including Black females at risk of breast cancer.","Overall, we intend to develop and test a community-level intervention targeting a structural need with the African American community of East Oakland that acknowledges the importance of community-based knowledge and agency. Our first aim was to partner with the People’s Advisory Council (PAC)—a steering committee of residents who support Black health, community, culture, and belonging. We successfully established a partnership with the PAC through a series of meetings in 2023 and 2024 in which we presented our project goals and a Streetwzye demonstration. In November 2023 we presented to the internal Roots 40x40 leaders and separately to the Roots Research and Evaluation Committee, an executive advisory council. In February 2024 we presented to the 40x40 Leadership Council with leaders from the Black Cultural Zone, the East Oakland Youth Coordination Center, and the Brotherhood of Elders Network. Finally, in July 2024 we presented to the PAC. After each presentation, discussions focused on technical aspects of the Streetwyze platform and ideal characteristics of a data trust. The PAC discussed how we would share data with council members and others who need to consider community input and recommended providing a resource directory with links on the platform map. Advisors indicated pedestrian and street safety as a priority concern affecting community health and well-being. Our second aim was to design needed adaptations of the Streetwyze platform; we intend to include resources on the platform via links and map locations. Our third research aim was to collaboratively prepare a full research proposal for submission to Phase II. We are working on the aims for our full proposal now, focusing on pedestrian and street safety. Roots and Streetwyze are finalizing an MOU for select community advisors on the PAC to use Streetwyze so they can offer informed suggestions for its use in their efforts.

A barrier experienced was the amount of time required to establish our partnership with the PAC. Regular meetings among our team assured continued momentum and connection. We used these meetings to prepare presentations, learn more about ongoing 40x40 work, and brainstorm ways to incorporate Streetwyze into those efforts."

The rate of breast cancer has also been rising in young women, which has not been observed in older women. Studies have shown young women are more likely to be diagnosed with later staged, more aggressive tumors and have poorer survival. To improve breast cancer outcomes in young women, timely diagnosis is imperative, however young women have been found to be more likely to experience delays in their breast cancer diagnosis. Currently, no study has examined the underlying reasons for these delays in young women in the U.S. 

We are proposing to conduct the Breast Cancer in Young Women: Awareness, Views, Experiences (BRAVE) Study to understand what contributes to a timely breast cancer diagnosis for young women and providers and to determine how our study’s findings can inform efforts for timely diagnosis in young women. To address these objectives, we will conduct focus groups of women who were diagnosed with breast cancer under age 40 within the past 10 years in California to capture their pre-diagnostic experiences, including their awareness, attitudes, and behaviors leading up to their diagnoses. We will also conduct in-depth, one-on-one interviews with healthcare providers who routinely see young female patients in their California-based practice to capture each provider’s perceptions, approach, and procedures to diagnosing a young woman with breast cancer. These focus groups and interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed to identify thematic patterns. We will then share the study’s findings by presenting them to our Community Advisory Board, which will include well-respected researchers, providers, and survivors, as well as organizing a Data Walk event for study participants, community members, and relevant stakeholders. These dissemination plans will help the community partner better understand how to improve timely diagnosis of breast cancer in young women. Given that young women are often overlooked when it comes to breast cancer preventive care and the young breast cancer survivor community is understudied, this project will raise awareness that young women get breast cancer too and help the community partner and their efforts to promote timely diagnosis of breast cancer in future young women.",

Non-menstrual feminine hygiene products (FHPs), including douches, wipes, and sprays, can contain multiple chemicals that induce genetic mutations and disrupt hormones. Use of FHPs on highly permeable genital skin may contribute to breast cancer risk more than other personal care products. Black women, who have the highest breast cancer mortality rate, also have the highest use of FHPs. Our long-term goal is to conduct an intervention study to reduce urinary concentrations of 1000+ breast cancer-related chemicals (BCRCs) in 200 Black participants by replacing common FHPs with lower toxicity alternatives. Using CRC pilot funding, we will form a community-research partnership to conduct comprehensive chemical analyses of common FHPs and lower toxicity alternatives; compare results to ingredients lists; develop participant surveys; and obtain ethics approval for the full study.

Research questions. 1) What are the most commonly used FHPs on the market and what lower toxicity alternatives exist? 2) What is the true chemical make-up of these products and alternatives and how do they deviate from listed ingredients? 3) How can we most effectively frame and structure our participant survey questions to gather information on their current use of feminine hygiene products and other relevant information?

General methodology. We will establish a community-research partnership to collaborate with stakeholders and the community at large on research design, implementation, and dissemination. We will conduct analyses capable of detecting 200+ chemicals on a diverse set of 25 commonly used FHPs plus 25 alternatives with no listed BCRC ingredients for analyses. We will compare analytical results with the products’ ingredients lists and describe breast cancer-relevant exposures. We will develop participant surveys to be administered before and after the intervention period to capture current FHP use, demographics, and other relevant information.

Innovative elements. The contribution of FHPs to breast cancer risk has not yet been explored. Our proposed project will be the first to conduct an intervention study on the effect of FHP use on BCRC biomarkers or to use comprehensive chemical analyses on a set of FHPs. It will be the first project funded by CBCRP to focus on FHPs.",

Women who have been exposed to SHSe are more likely to develop breast cancer than women unexposed to SHSe. More VA men tend to smoke cigarettes than other groups, placing VA women at high risk for SHSe. Despite the prevalent SHSe among VA women, there is a gap in research on this topic with regards to the cultural, historical and familial contexts within the VA community. Thus, our study seeks to explore multilevel determinants of SHSe as a breast cancer risk factor among VA women. Specifically, the proposed study will identify cultural, neighborhood, family dynamics, and community norms in relation to SHSe within the VA community. Based on the findings, the ultimate goal is to develop culturally appropriate strategies to reduce tobacco exposure and improve breast health among VA women.",

Latina breast cancer (BC) patients living in rural areas have many challenges (e.g., language barriers, lack of knowledge, transportation) in accessing and utilizing financial resources. Financial navigation (FN), a structured intervention to assist patients in accessing financial resources, has been considered a helpful intervention. Previous studies have found that the FN program is feasible and beneficial for cancer patients, but to our knowledge, no feasibility study has been conducted with Latina BC patients in rural regions. Kern County Cancer Foundation (KCCF)-San Diego State University (SDSU) partnership aims to refine and expand the existing KCCF FN program to target Latina BC patients who live in rural areas and examine if it is feasible and effective in addressing financial toxicity. Research questions include: 1) Is the culturally targeted FN program feasible and acceptable?  and 2) Will the FN program reduce financial distress and increase health-related quality of life?  In Phase I, we will adapt intervention elements and materials (e.g., brochures and handouts) to fit the Latina BC patients based on feedback from three focus groups (n=24) (Aim 1). Focus group participants will discuss the clarity of information, appropriateness of the format, and layout of the materials. In Phase II, we will conduct one group pre-posttest pilot trial with 60 Latina BC patients. The FN intervention comprises 6 modules, including an introduction and FN intake module, three core service modules (e.g., financial assistance program), an education/coaching module, and an ending session. This intervention will be offered via a mobile van in rural areas. All patients will receive two weekly in-person sessions, followed by three phone calls over a period of 3 months by two full-time bilingual/bicultural financial navigators. We will assess if the FN intervention is feasible and acceptable (Aim 2) and if the intervention reduces financial distress and increases health-related quality of life (Aim 3). This community-partnered participatory research approach can effectively address the cancer community's needs regarding financial toxicity and enhance community capacity to sustain the FN program.",

Like an onion, there are several layers that require peeling to understand the complete picture of this disease. While the disease impacts people of different races, ethnicities and cultural backgrounds, Black women are impacted the most. For example, Black women are more likely to die from the disease, they get diagnosed later, and may not have the same access to healthcare as White women. Scientists have some ideas as to why there are these differences between different groups and one of those developing ideas is related to environmental exposures from everyday use of personal care products. There are chemicals in our products that have been shown to be harmful to people’s health, including putting some people at risk of breast cancer. Because of research, we now understand that Black women and girls are exposed to these chemicals at earlier ages than other groups and these chemicals are connected to breast cancer development and advancement of this disease. Unfortunately, research information often does not reach communities quickly enough for solutions to be developed. In fact, the time gap between when research is conducted and when communities can use the information is about 17 years. The communities that would benefit the most from learning more about this information are often left out of these discussions. When Black communities are engaged in these educational efforts, we know that knowledge also increases which is a good first step towards improving people’s lives for the better. So, we—Celebrate Life Cancer Ministry (CLCM) and the Bench to Community Initiative (BCI)—are bringing together researchers, health advocates, breast cancer survivors or thrivers, community-based organizations, and media representatives to a virtual symposium to learn about these harmful chemicals and breast cancer risk with an emphasis on Black women and girls. The symposium will be on three separate days in September and people will learn about new research on this topic and receive practical skills and resources on reducing their exposures to these harmful chemicals and breast cancer risk. The speakers will be young scientists and their mentors from communities that need the information. We will also include people 13 years and older, as this important topic is for everyone that’s impacted by breast cancer.",

""Work with community groups to provide culturally tailored education and advocacy on how to reduce the disproportionate impact of breast cancer risk factors for under-resourced communities, including rural, tribal, and communities of color.""

In the statewide survey and eight regional meetings, participants emphasized the desire for culturally tailored, community-led education and advocacy materials to help communities understand how their priorities impact breast cancer risk and other health harms. 

Environmental health literacy (EHL) empowers communities to understand environmental health impacts, take individual actions to reduce their risk, and act collectively at the community level. EHL encompasses the wide range of skills needed to take environmental health information and make informed decisions, improve quality of life, reduce health risks, and protect the environment.  

At the CLASP-BC Phase 1 regional meetings, groups working on food security, safe bike lanes, and water quality often didn't see the link between their work and breast cancer prevention until BCPP covered the science behind the project's 15 breast cancer risk factors. Communities consistently expressed the need for this information in accessible formats. Any collective action to prevent breast cancer must start with the community understanding the impact of their risk factors. Materials must be provided in multiple languages and formats, including graphics and videos for communities with low literacy or non-written languages, and be delivered by trusted messengers. 

With this Planning Grant, BCPP will work with community groups, health practitioners, and academics to identify 2-3 underserved, high-risk communities that would most benefit from culturally tailored breast cancer prevention materials. We will then develop a Full Award plan to identify leaders to create Community Advisory Committees to develop breast cancer prevention materials with the research team. These resources will then be disseminated and tested for effectiveness in both educating community members and ultimately, motivating community action to reduce risk.",

Yet only 43% of women in California are still breastfeeding at 12 months because of barriers out of their control. One of the biggest barriers new mothers face is getting quality breastfeeding support after having a baby. This is especially true for Black women, who have a higher chance of dying from breast cancer and getting breast cancer under the age of 40. Getting breastfeeding support is also hard for non-english speakers, low-income families, and other communities that are often not included in health services like LGBTQAI families. The purpose of the Breast Cancer Prevention Lactation Accessibility for Thriving Community Health (LATCH) Plan is to better understand the challenges these communities face when trying to get help, create a comprehensive statewide directory of breastfeeding support services, and provide free breastfeeding phone support in multiple languages. We plan on working with lactation professionals, breastfeeding coalitions, breast cancer experts and the California families most affected by lack of access to breastfeeding support. The information we gather from these advocates, professionals, and parents will help us in creating the most complete breastfeeding support directory in California and the launch of a free breastfeeding phone support helpline.

The practice has been to cap these soils at the surface with concrete or clay to keep rain from mobilizing the contaminants. However, in coastal areas the process of rising sea level will push shallow groundwater up at many locations, potentially mobilizing these contaminants from below. Mobilized VOCs can enter indoor air via sewer connections or openings in building foundations and expose people to chemicals associated with increased risk of breast cancer (Miller et al 2020, Kay et al 2024). One study found more than 1,400 sites with contaminants over rising groundwater in the San Francisco Bay Area alone (Hill et al 2023). Most are in underserved areas where people are already exposed to higher levels of pollution. Recent wet winters may have already mobilized contaminants at some sites, since rain can seasonally elevate shallow groundwater by several feet. Groundwater monitoring is absent or very limited, and it is not designed to register maximum levels or check for movement of contaminants offsite. 
 
We will use the Full Award to develop a method that would allow government agencies to systematically identify buildings where people are now or may in the near future be at risk of VOC penetration by contaminants associated with increased risk of breast cancer that originate in groundwater. During the Planning Grant, we will pilot our methods on the south Richmond shoreline in the San Francisco Bay Area, where VOCs are known to be present in groundwater and where occupied buildings are connected to sewer lines in the flow path of VOCs. This pilot has three goals: first, to develop a mapping process that identifies sewer lines at risk of VOC infiltration and buildings at risk of indoor air penetration. Second, we will develop a dialogue within our team about methods for sewer and indoor air monitoring in preparation for the Full Proposal. Third, we will develop communication materials to help the public become aware of these risks.

Nearly 1 million Californians lack safe drinking water, and two-thirds of failing water systems are in low-income, underserved communities. A previous CBCRP-funded drinking water study conducted by UC Davis detected several contaminants in California drinking water linked to breast cancer, such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 1,2,3-trichloropropane, and di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP).

We plan to build upon the UC Davis drinking water project into underserved communities in the Central Valley and/or Central Coast of California. These regions are disproportionately impacted by groundwater contamination due to their close proximity to agricultural fields, oil extraction sites, landfills, hazardous waste sites, or other industrial areas. Some of the small communities in these regions receive bottled water as a short-term solution. However, this type of solution risks exposure to phthalate compounds and a long-term, affordable and sustainable solution is essential for reducing exposures and improving health and quality of life in these populations.

Our proposed Full Award project aims to monitor water contaminants, create culturally relevant educational materials, and develop a community-level intervention that will benefit those impacted by contaminated water and ultimately reduce breast cancer risk. Engaging community members at every stage of the project is imperative to ensure long-term success; thus, during the Planning Grant, we will build relationships with community organizations and members in the regions. For example, the Community Water Center is a community-based organization and is currently engaged in efforts to implement 1,2,3-trichloropropane treatment for domestic wells and small water systems. Once we have developed an understanding of a community’s specific water issues and needs, we will work with CWC, UC Davis, policy makers, health practitioners, and other stakeholders such as Pesticide Action Network and the Safe Ag Safe Schools coalition, to strategize on topics including water monitoring methods, filtration systems as a way to reduce exposure, and community education around taking action on water contamination.",

There would be an additional listening session for immigrant Latina household workers cleaning private homes to share existing barriers in eliminating toxic cleaning products at work, as well as their overall perceptions about breast cancer risks. The goal would be to better understand what type of messaging and research would help encourage green cleaning products amongst workers and employers. Given the existing lack of health and safety protections for household workers in the country and ongoing efforts to eliminate the exclusion of domestic work from occupational health laws in California, the aim of this project is to provide more concrete recommendations to Cal OSHA on what implementation the Cleaning Product Right to Know for the Domestic Work Industry should look like. 
In 2017, the Cleaning Product Right to Know Act, also known as SB 258, passed in California, requiring consumer cleaning products sold in the state to disclose ingredients both online and on the product label. While an important step forward, the law did not adequately address the needs and concerns of domestic workers. Having a list of chemical names does not communicate the health risk domestic workers experience while using these products, often all day, 5 days a week or more.

Women are exposed to a wide array of toxic chemicals throughout their life course that are known to increase breast cancer risk (e.g.pesticides such as malathion). The research that has produced this evidence has been limited to studying one single chemical at a time. However, women are exposed to multiple chemicals simultaneously. It is unknown whether exposures to chemical mixtures have a larger effect on breast cancer risk than exposure to single chemicals. Biological markers (biomarkers) of exposure are needed to serve as an indication of past or current exposure. DNA methylation is a biomarker that changes in response to environmental exposures. DNA methylation is a reversible chemical process that regulates the activity of genes. 

HYPOTHESES
1. Exposure to mixtures of toxic chemicals is associated with higher risk for breast cancer compared to exposure to single chemicals 
2. DNA methylation biomarkers can serve as a biomarker of exposure to chemical mixtures that increase breast cancer risk.  

METHODS
We will measure the abundance of thousands of chemicals in archived blood samples of 300 women who developed breast cancer and 300 samples of women who did not. We will examine which chemicals have higher abundance in women who developed breast cancer. We will then create mixtures by grouping chemicals based on their impact on human health and other factors. We will then examine whether exposure to each mixture increases breast cancer risk and identify which of the chemicals in each mixture has the greatest impact on risk. All blood samples will also be sent for DNA methylation array analysis. We will then investigate whether there are specific DNA sites that are different among women with high total exposure to all the chemicals in a mixture and investigate which biological process are affected.  

IMPACT
The findings can inform regulations on the use and release of toxic chemicals mixtures. DNA methylation biomarkers can be included in breast cancer risk models to find women at highest risk and intervene to reduce their risk.","Introduction
Women are exposed to a wide array of toxic chemicals throughout their life course that are known to increase breast cancer risk (e.g.pesticides such as malathion). It is unknown whether exposures to chemical mixtures have a larger effect on breast cancer risk than exposure to single chemicals. Biological markers (biomarkers) of exposure are needed to serve as an indication of past or current exposure. DNA methylation is a biomarker that changes in response to environmental exposures.The aim of this study is to identify which mixtures of chemicals have the greatest impact on breast cancer risk using non-targeted analysis and determine whether there are DNA methylation signatures that can serve as biomarkers of exposure. The findings can inform regulations on the use and release of toxic chemicals mixtures. DNA methylation biomarkers can be included in breast cancer risk models to find women at highest risk and intervene to reduce their risk.

Progress to Date 
IRB approval from UCLA and UCI obtained. Business service agreement between UCSF and UCLA completed. Material transfer agreements between UCSF and Emroy completed for non-targeted analysis and UCSF and UCI completed for DNA methylation analysis. Test set of 107 serum samples sent to Emroy for non-targeted analysis. Test set of 10 serum samples sent to UCI for DNA methylation analysis. Monthly meetings held with three advocates. A plan for a series of blog posts were developed with Zero Breast Cancer. Two blog post have been completed, one of which was published. 

Barriers and Resolutions
Difficulties in establishing the business service agreement between UCSF and UCLA which was eventually resolved by the financial teams. PI K Badal was on medical leave for three months (10/24-12/24) which delayed progress somewhat. Person leading the cancer registry linkage to obtain outcome data left UCSF so there has been delays completing this linkage. UCLA staff are delayed on completing their tasks as they were evacuated due to the Palisades fire. 

Major Accomplishments 
None to date

Future Directions
Our next immediate steps are to complete the geocoding for UCI and UCLA, select the remainder of samples for analysis and ship to Emroy and UCI respectively. Once this is complete, data analysis will begin."

The conference will bring together experts from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines, including (but not limited to!) physicians (oncology, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, radiology, among others), basic scientists, advocates, entrepreneurs, policy makers, regulators, and venture capital/investment sector leaders from across the United States and the world. We will apply this wealth of varied expertise to three main focus areas: 1) new breast cancer subtypes and drugs/treatments that can be successfully used to get rid of tumors in the early-stage setting; 2) early endpoints (including imaging) and new trial designs that can accelerate learning, funding, and FDA approvals for treatment, screening and prevention; 3) highlight important research surrounding the biology of breast cancer and of the hormonal cycle control in women. As our understanding of breast cancer improves, we should use this knowledge to upgrade the hormonal control products that millions of women worldwide take over the course of their lifetime with a goal of reducing breast cancer incidence.  

The event will consist of poster sessions to highlight research as well as a series of speaker and discussion sessions. The conference is designed to foster questions, collaborations, and overall generation of new ideas and ways of thinking about breast cancer, with none of the sessions overlapping each other so people can attend everything they want to. 

The conference will be held over two and a half days (Thursday – Saturday) in Fall 2024 in San Francisco. We are especially excited about the city of San Francisco as the location for the event and hope that the can-do, entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley will energize attendees to challenge the status quo and take action. We will build this notion of idea to implementation into the conference: we will hold a competition for the best idea for incorporating breast cancer prevention into the hormone-based OB/GYN care women already receive-- and a prize of working with Bay Area biotech and investment leaders to make that idea a reality.",

Although the number of BCa deaths has decreased over time, it is still one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in women overall and the most common among Hispanic women. Early detection of BCa via screening programs has helped reduce mortality. Imaging modalities such as contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have greatly improved BCa detection; however, these modalities are not suitable for routine screening due to high cost, limited availability or exposure to radiation and contrast agents. 2D mammography (2D MG) has been routinely used for BCa screening; however, it has a high false positive rate, a high false negative rate and cannot provide clinical insight until a lesion is visible on imaging, which limits early detection. Volumetric mammographic imaging of the breast using digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has been reported to improve BCa detection; however, DBT is associated with a higher radiation exposure to the patient. The increased availability of artificial intelligence (AI) and imaging informatics tools have made it possible to detect pre-malignancy signal and triage women with different risk profiles. In this proposed study, we will combine the strength of advanced image processing methods, AI and advanced statistical modeling, to derive an innovative biomarker: pre-malignancy index (PMI). By leveraging PMI, we can further construct a digital twin for breast health. Under this framework, we can aggregate health information including family history, lifestyle, genomic makeup, and observable physical traits to project the future trajectory of breast health. Furthermore, using digital twin framework based on PMI, we can monitor BCa risk and simulate responses from different lifestyle modifications in minimizing the risk of BCa.",

A successful example is the use of PARP inhibitors to treat patients with harmful BRCA mutations. Unfortunately, even with targeted therapy, the development of drug resistance poses a significant challenge.  Our research proposal aims to generate new therapeutics that will address this problem.

DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) has emerged as a promising target for developing a new class of drugs for breast cancer treatment. POLQ levels are abnormally high in 70% of breast cancers, particularly those with poor prognosis, including the triple negative breast cancer. These tumor cells rely on POLQ to survive, especially under conditions of cell stress, whereas normal cells do not depend on POLQ for viability. We have shown that by inhibiting POLQ, we can also kill BRCA variant tumors that have acquired PARP inhibitor resistance. To become an effective treatment for patients, POLQ inhibitors still face the challenge of maintaining sufficient levels in the body to kill cancer cells. In this study, we will use a powerful new tool known as click chemistry (which is a pioneering method of joining molecules together to manufacture new drugs), developed by Dr. Barry Sharpless (2022 Nobel Prize Chemistry). With the addition of innovative PROTAC (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras) technology, we plan to develop a new class of POLQ inhibitors that will provide long lasting and effective treatment.

We have successfully identified promising new POLQ inhibitor leads and propose to further improve the potency and minimize potential side effects. We will test the efficacy of these new inhibitors in both cell-based assays and mouse breast cancer models. 

Our innovative approach to develop new types of POLQ inhibitors will yield compounds with high potency and prolonged duration, effectively addressing the current challenges associated with POLQ inhibition and enhancing the likelihood of success in clinical settings. The success of our study will pave the way for specific and effective targeted treatment for patients with breast cancer and has the potential to improve survival rates as well as quality of life.",

TNBC frequently recurs after standard breast cancer treatment. Few targeted treatments are available for TNBC, and they are limited in scope and effectiveness, and have adverse side effects. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need to develop new targeted therapies that would prevent metastasis and benefit many women with TNBC. 

We have identified a protein, t-SATB1, that we hypothesize to be a promising target for TNBC therapy based on the following innovative discoveries.  We found that this protein is expressed specifically in breast cancer cells with high metastatic activity, and not in healthy cells.  We identified a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) that cells use to produce this protein and devised a method to specifically degrade this mRNA to eliminate this protein in metastatic breast cancer cells. Indeed, this method readily kills TNBC cells grown in cell culture, showing that tumor cells can be effectively eliminated. Further, when we injected TNBC cells into the blood stream of mice, our targeted-elimination method blocked TNBC cells from growing in the lungs to form new tumors in mice, preventing metastasis. 

Using an approach called “xenograft,” we propose to implant piece of human tumor donated by TNBC patients in the breast of mice and test the efficacy of our approach. We hypothesize that t-SATB1 elimination will block metastasis. We will also monitor safety of our approach by studying any side effects, both at the organism health level as well as at the gene expression level. Because the targeted protein is not present in normal cells, we expect that side effects will be minimal.  

If our research is successful, we anticipate that our approach may lay the critical groundwork to develop a new type of targeted therapy for TNBC to effectively block metastatic recurrence while minimizing adverse effects of treatment, thus saving many lives. Because t-SATB1 is found in other types of aggressive breast cancers, we anticipate that our approach may be readily applied more broadly, and our antibody that detects t-SATB1 will be a useful diagnostic tool to identify patients who may benefit from this treatment.",

Breast cancer metastasis, where cells spread from a primary site to other parts of the body, is a major challenge in cancer treatment.  Imagine cancer cells as tiny invaders that navigate through the body, seeking new territories. What if we could interfere with their navigation system, making it harder for them to spread? Our project is at the forefront of this exciting possibility, focusing on breast cancer, a type that affects millions worldwide and is the most common cancer in women in the US.
Our research focuses on filopodia, cellular ""fingers"" guiding movement through tumor-surrounding areas. These ""fingers"" help cancer cells decide where to move, especially through the dense and stiff areas around tumors. Our goal is to find a way to halt these fingers, stopping breast cancer cells from moving and spreading.
Our team has discovered a promising substance, which we refer to as #26, that can do just that. It targets and blocks the action of filopodia, showing great potential in preventing the spread of breast cancer cells without harming the body's healthy cells. This discovery could revolutionize how we approach breast cancer treatment, offering hope for strategies that prevent cancer from reaching other body parts.
How are we doing this? Through a series of experiments that combine biology and chemistry, we are testing how well #26 can stop breast cancer cells in their tracks and exploring how #26 affect cancer cells' ability to sense and respond to their environment, aiming to understand exactly how they work.
What makes our project innovative is the discovery of #26, and our approach in studying its effects and potential. If successful, we could identify new treatments that specifically target the ability of cancer cells to spread, opening up new avenues for preventing metastasis in breast cancer.
The impact of our work could be significant, offering new hope for treatments that go beyond current methods, focusing on stopping cancer from spreading rather than just shrinking tumors. Our research is a step toward a future where breast cancer can be effectively contained, reducing the threat they pose to patients worldwide.",

We hypothesize that exposure to pathogens cause breast cancer and breast cancer lethality. This is because pathogens, particularly those that establish infection in the breast, demonstrate many carcinogenic qualities such as driving chronic inflammation and mutations to the DNA. Yet, research has not been conducted to learn which types of infection act as carcinogens and put populations at risk for breast cancer and breast cancer being lethal. Our lab has designed an innovative multi-omics pipeline to trace infections with pathogens that act as carcinogens in clinical trial datasets.  This is important because these exposures are frequent and pathogen exposures initiate cancer hallmarks and change the types of treatments that would work for patients. Our study recruits patients who have infection and breast cancer; which allows us to specifically study at risk patients. Our novel preclinical studies of breast cancer and infection will show us how exposure to pathogens can cause breast cancer hallmarks and lethality. In our study we test and deliver new concepts for preventative strategies to minimize risk of breast cancer by blocking pathogen driven cancer hallmarks like tumor promoting inflammation and tumor blood vessel formation eliminate cancer risk. We also design novel combination immune checkpoint treatments and use them with interventions specific for comorbid infection. This is important because these patients have diminished immune function– but no studies have been done on how to restore the ability of their immune system to recognize and kill breast cancer cells.  We close this gap by delineating treatments that restore anti-tumor and anti-pathogen immune function.  As an outcome of these results and this study, we will impact breast cancer prevention, treatment, community engagement, and political policy by providing clear data on which types of infectious exposures put people at risk for lethal breast cancer.  Therefore, this study will motivate action to implement new concepts for how breast cancer initiates and progresses and effective prevention and treatment strategies to block the ability of pathogens to cause breast cancer or make breast cancer lethal.","Appreciating the profound influence of the microbiome and pathogens on cancer development and therapeutic response, we propose investigating the impact of persistent infection on critical characteristics of cancer initiation, development, and response to therapy. As a potentially clinically relevant and common persistent infection, Bb causes Lyme Disease (LD): the fastest growing vector-borne disease world-wide; setting the stage for high incidences of disease comorbidity. In support, we find epidemiological evidence demonstrating the presence of infectious organisms including Bb in human breast cancer (BC). The clinical significance remains unknown, yet Bb shuts down germinal center responses which facilitate anti-tumor immune responses in patient tumors. Thus, we hypothesize that BC patients with persistent Bb infection will be disproportionately impacted by cancer risk and treatment failure. This prompts us to test the influence of persistent infection and LD-BC comorbidity on tumor progression, immunology, and requirements for effective therapy. These findings would bridge current gaps in knowledge regarding the consequences of dysfunctional immune states created by Bb. Investigating the carcinogenic potential of this pathogen and persistent infection in general would guide novel personalized precision therapy and aid in cancer prevention. Moreover, we plan to extend our expertise and ability to restore effective B cell activity in cancer to eradicate Bb infection in LD. 

Progress: Overall, the progress on this study has included hiring and training a new project leader, collection of human tumor samples for sequencing and pathogen detection, optimizing our mouse model experiments for study, and detecting the impact of infection on the immunology and tissue homeostasis of the mammary gland. Together, this has provided a well trained new project leader, potentially optimal human samples for study, improvement of experimental systems, and preliminary insights as to how infection may elicit disruption to elicit enhanced breast cancer risk/"

Firefighter cancer research has focused on male cohorts, with little study of women. However, in epidemiological studies that included some female firefighters, nearly half of all cancers were breast cancers and breast cancer incidence was higher than in the general public. Hence, our team is studying the exposures and biological mechanisms that increase breast cancer risk among female firefighters. 

Measuring early biomarkers of cancer can help identify causes, and new methods are needed. In its 2023 Monographs, IARC noted strong mechanistic evidence of DNA damage (genotoxicity) associated with occupational exposure as a firefighter. This is unsurprising because products of combustion are genotoxic, however there are likely other important exposures contributing to mutations and breast cancer. Since mutations are an intermediate step between DNA damage and cancer, and can also result from non-genotoxic processes, assessing mutations may provide a more predictive biomarker for cancer risk. 

We propose to measure the burden and patterns of mutations associated with firefighting using two comparisons: 1) female firefighters compared to matched office workers and 2) female firefighters at recruitment baseline and after 2-3 years of firefighting. Using novel and highly accurate error-corrected DNA sequencing technology, we will measure mutation frequency and identify mutational signatures overrepresented among firefighters. We will compare these signatures to a reference database and our previous exposure measurements to predict which occupational exposures most likely caused the mutations. To further refine predictions of mutagenic chemicals in smoke, we will use computational approaches to model DNA lesions caused by this class of chemicals. 

Our research supports breast cancer prevention by applying a novel technology to identify early biomarkers predictive of risk. Our team will support firefighter risk reduction throughout the project. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated to the fire service and study participants, providing a scientific basis for interventions to reduce breast cancer risk among women firefighters.","OVERVIEW
This research aims to examine the occupational exposures and biological mechanisms that drive breast cancer risk among female firefighters with our community and research partners at the Women Workers Biomonitoring Collaborative (WWBC) and the Fire Fighter Cancer Cohort Study (FFCCS).  Our approach examines frequencies and patterns of DNA mutations and how chemicals in smoke damage DNA and lead to mutations.       
PROGRESS
We utilize novel error-corrected DNA duplex sequencing to reveal mutational frequencies and signatures that are not detected by standard next-generation sequencing.  We procured custom sequencing kits and prepared the accompanying sequencing and bioinformatics workflows by working with our partners at TwinStrand Biosciences and the UCLA Technology Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics.  With these now established, samples from the WWBC and FFCCS bio-repositories have been identified from survey and demographic data to examine DNA mutations both cross-sectionally and longitudinally as put forth in our Aims 1 & 2.  
Our novel computational approach (Aim 3) involves modeling DNA damage caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at mutational hotspots in the genome that can drive breast cancer risk.  We have parameterized molecular mechanics force fields and developed computer algorithms that allow us to examine how differences in the structure of various PAHs impacts their affinity to form DNA lesions and evade DNA repair mechanisms.     
BARRIERS
We overcame a production halt and delivery delays at Twinstrand by working with their team to conduct a special production run for our project, allowing us to remain on track to complete our DNA sequencing and bioinformatics aims.  Kits were received in late 2024 and we are now pulling samples from our bio-repositories to begin sequencing.  Note that this bumped sequencing costs from the year 1 budget into the year 2 budget.  We also moved up our computational workflow to make progress on Aim 3 while working through sequencing kit delivery delays.
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Our novel computational approach was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences citing support from this grant.  
CONTINUATION
In 2025, we will be conducting DNA sequencing and starting molecular dynamics simulations of PAH-DNA adducts in gene sequence contexts that drive breast cancer risk."

One in ten breast cancer patients is of reproductive age when they are diagnosed. Young breast cancer patients are at risk of infertility from cancer treatments due to direct ovarian toxicity from alkylating and platinating chemotherapy, sterilization from removing ovaries, and/or reproductive aging during prolonged time on hormone therapy. Fertility preservation before breast cancer treatment can decrease infertility risks. Patients want to learn about their risks, engage in shared decision-making on fertility preservation, and do fertility preservation when appropriate. 

Oncofertility care involves educating patients about reproductive risks and fertility preservation and providing access to fertility preservation services. Because oncofertility care doesn’t reach many patients, many policies from state laws like Senate Bill 600 that require health insurance plans to cover fertility preservation to fertility clinic policies to facilitate care have been enacted, but we lack a summary of policies and their effectiveness in promoting delivery of oncofertility care. Thus, we lack the evidence to make sound policies in this area. 

The investigator team has complementary clinical, policy, research, and advocacy expertise in oncofertility care and a history of working together. They will convene an Advisory Panel of researchers, leaders, decision makers, and community groups to undertake this work. They will complete rapid reviews of published and public data. They will hold a Symposium to hear from stakeholders, present data and experiences, and workshop ideas on key evidence and policy recommendations. The investigators and Advisory Panel will generate summaries of their findings and evidence-based policy recommendations for dissemination. The team will then support dissemination of project deliverables to promote the equitable delivery of oncofertility care to young breast cancer patients in California.",

Most mammograms are now three-dimentional (3D) tomography exams, which have more than 50 pictures of each breast instead of just a single two-dimentional picture. These 3D exams require longer interpretation times, leading to further exhaustion for radiologists, longer patient wait times, delays in breast cancer diagnoses, and poor quality of care. While artificial intelligence tools may improve accuracy, its impact on interpretation time and radiologists' well-being remains unknown. 

We will conduct a two-year randomized clinical trial on the impact of artificial intelligence on screening mammography accuracy involving over 90,000 exams at UCLA Health. We will assess whether artificial intelligence will catch cancers missed by radiologists and reduce false positives. During the trial radiologists will interpret half of the images with and half without artificial intelligence support.  

For this California Breast Cancer Research Program award, we propose adding new data collection during the trial to allow us to study the concurrent impact of artificial intelligence on efficiency and wait times. We aim to determine if artificial intelligence helps radiologists interpret mammograms faster without compromising accuracy and if it can reduce their fatigue and burnout. We will begin by consulting UCLA breast radiologists and surveying California practitioners to get their perspectives on artificial intelligence tools. Collaborating with patient advocates, we'll ensure the survey captures patient-centric concerns. We will also track interpretation time during the trial, allowing us to evaluate efficiency along with accuracy, while post-trial discussions will provide insight into radiologists' experiences.

Our study will offer new insights into integrating artificial intelligence tools into breast cancer screening, informing real-world practice. By understanding artificial intelligence’s impact on efficiency and burnout, we aim to optimize its implementation statewide, empowering radiologists to focus on complex cases, patient care, and diverse communities.

For this new project, UCLA will partner with Cancer Kinship, a community organization in Southern California that provides support services to cancer patients. Cancer Kinship has extensive experience working with cancer patients in a community setting and collaborating with other community groups. We will also work with researchers from UC-Irvine who specialize in cancer care interventions. 

The overall goal of this project is to plan and develop a proposal to create a model for cancer patients to navigate care, designed for community organizations to use. Unlike hospital or insurance-based navigation programs, this model will be tailored specifically for community groups working with culturally diverse populations.

During the 12-month planning phase, the team will review the literature for current practices in patient navigation among community-based organizations that work with diverse communities. We will design a research approach intended to identify what patients most need from navigation services and what community-based groups can provide most effectively. The results will inform a model for navigation services that community groups can use. The model will include strategies for adapting the services to address cultural differences and needs of the communities served. 

Over the course of 12 months, our team from UCLA, Cancer Kinship and UC Irvine will work together on several key tasks. We will: (1) review existing models of patient navigation services to identify best practices; (2) identify additional community partners that serve that serve diverse communities; (3) identify information gaps about what patients most need from navigation services; (4) develop a project timeline; and (5) write a draft proposal.  

At the end of the planning period, we will have a proposal describing a project that would develop and test the feasibility of a community-based patient navigation model that will help community organizations provide culturally responsive care for cancer patients.",

Despite significant progress in cancer care, young Black women face distinct barriers to accessing breast health services and essential resources, leading to unmet needs within this population. This project will bring together advocates, researchers, and community members to collaboratively identify these barriers and design culturally responsive solutions that improve access, support, and overall quality of care.

Our first objective is to conduct a comprehensive review of existing data from community health advocates, healthcare providers, and community members, identifying key obstacles that impact breast health access in Southern California. We will also examine The GREEN Foundation’s current referral practices through interviews with staff, volunteers, survivors, and their families, providing a broader understanding of how technology might enhance resource connections and ease barriers to care.

To ensure community engagement and project alignment, we will host monthly planning meetings with The GREEN Foundation, local advocates, healthcare partners, and community agencies. These meetings will allow us to gather ongoing feedback and make iterative adjustments based on community priorities, creating a project that genuinely reflects the needs of those it aims to support.

Furthermore, monthly co-design workshops will be facilitated with survivors and their families to develop a gender-sensitive, culturally relevant socio-technical solution. These workshops will empower participants to contribute to a project that is tailored to the distinct needs of marginalized groups in Southern California, ensuring that the final design directly addresses the challenges they face.

The insights from these activities will be synthesized into a detailed report, which will inform a grant proposal dedicated to advancing tailored interventions for young adult cancer survivors in underserved communities. By combining community insights, research expertise, and collaborative design, this project seeks to create sustainable, impactful improvements in breast health access and care for young Black women, with a vision to enhance health equity and long-term outcomes within this community.",

The transduction of the Hh signaling relies on the primary cilium, a tiny cell surface organelle that functions as the hub of cell signaling. To reveal new cilium proteins related to the Hh pathway, we have conducted a proximity-based proteomic studies, and uncovered novel cilium proteins. In this proposal, we will focus on one of the novel cilium proteins, Numb, to reveal its regulatory mechanism in the Hh pathway and the Hh-related tumor growth. 

Previous studies on Numb implicate this protein in asymmetric cell division and regulation of multiple signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanism of how Numb participates in these cellular processes remains controversial. Our discovery of Numb’s localization in the primary cilium may help elucidate the unknown mechanisms. We found that Numb loss of function leads to accumulation of a Hh transcription regulator, Gli3 repressor (Gli3R). For Hh pathway to be turned on, the Gli3R has to be degraded. Numb has been described as an adaptor protein that links target proteins to the E3 ligase, Itch. Therefore, we hypothesize that Numb is required to switch on the Hh signaling by degrading Gli3R. We will test this hypothesis via the following Aims: 1) Determine roles of Numb as an adaptor of ubiquitin ligase for Gli3R; 2) Identify roles of Numb in the proliferation and differentiation of granule neuron precursors in the developing cerebellum; 3) Determine roles of Numb in the formation of medulloblastoma in mouse models. Our results will elucidate a new regulatory mechanism of the Hh pathway and Hh-related tumor formation.","This project is to study the regulation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, a pathway involved in many types of tumorigeneses. Hh signaling relies on primary cilium; this project aims to elucidate how a new ciliary protein, Numb, control Hh signal transduction in the cilium. 

We have completed Aim 1: Determine molecular mechanisms underlying Hh pathway regulation by Numb. We excluded these two possibilities: Numb control the proteolytic conversion of Gli3FL into Gli3R; or Numb regulate the degradation of Gli3R. We identified the true action of Numb in Hh signaling is to mediate the exit of Ptch from the cilium. Ptch is the receptor for Hh signaling. Via advanced optical imaging techniques, we found that Numb localizes to the ciliary pocket, a special area in the cilium where proteins are internalized into the cell to exit the cilium. Numb acts as a linker to incorporate Ptch into a cellular machinery so that Ptch can be internalized into the cell and exit the cilium. This step is required for the activation of Hh signaling.

For Aim2: Determine involvement of Numb in Hh-related MB formation. Instead of directly study the growth of medulloblastoma, we studied how genetic knockout of Numb impacts the proliferation of granule neuron precursors in the developing cerebellum. This new study is more relevant to the tumorigenesis of medulloblastoma, because this tumor is derived from Hh overactivation in granule neuron precursors. We found that genetic knockout of Numb blocked Hh signaling in these cells, and inhibited the precursor proliferation. These results highlight a new direction in inhibiting Hh signaling to suppress tumor growth. 

Plan for continuation of the research: After determined the molecular mechanism of how Numb regulates Hh signaling, we will study the biological processes where Hh signaling play essential roles, such as the tumor growth in mouse medulloblastoma model, and the development of cortex."

Aberrant transcriptional expression and epigenetic changes are common in cancer cells compared to normal cells. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently captured the interest of many researchers due to their ability to act as regulators and organizers of gene expression in the cell. We have identified a set of five conserved long non-coding RNAs required for cancer cell survival, based on data mining of screens for cancer associated long non-coding RNAs, and several published CRISPR-Cas9 screens of thousands of non-coding RNAs. Some of these lncRNAs have been studied previously in the context of cancer metastasis and progression, but the pathways in which they function are still unknown. 

We have developed a powerful mass spectrometry screen for specific lncRNA interacting factors that enables the identification of direct, zero-distance interactors with an RNA of interest. This method has already been successfully used to characterize the interacting factors of Xist lncRNA in embryonic stem cells, but no cancer related experiments have so far been performed. The experiments in this proposal will extend the method to cancer cell related lncRNAs, with the potential to discover a new set of regulatory roles for non-coding RNAs. 

Using this seed funding, we will explore the molecular basis for the observed cell growth phenotypes by establishing a knockdown and overexpression system for each of the five conserved lncRNAs. We will characterize the protein interactome and transcriptional changes induced by overexpression or deletion of each of these five conserved lncRNAs. Since many lncRNAs act as epigenetic regulators, it is anticipated that new signaling pathways for cancer cell growth may be revealed in this study. We plan to apply for external funding to continue to support this project, using the preliminary data gathered during the one-year period of the Cancer Research Coordinating Committee award.","This project aimed to explore the functions of conserved long non-coding ribonucleic acids (RNAs) in cancer cell growth. We discovered new roles and pathways for the activity of functional RNA molecules in human cancers. Most anti-cancer research has focused on the activities of proteins and their interactions in cells. However, non-coding RNAs are a newly identified class of regulatory molecules which can control cellular functions in humans, such as gene expression: which genes are turned on or off in a particular cell at any given time. Long non-coding RNAs do not code for proteins and instead can function on their own in the cell. We studied five non-coding RNAs which had previously been implicated in human cancer cell growth through large-scale screening experiments, but whose roles in the cell were unknown. To better understand the functions of these RNAs, we created overexpression and knockdown cell lines to control the levels of each lncRNA in cancer cells. We then performed growth measurements to determine whether the altered levels of each lncRNA had any effect on cancer cell survival. The gene expression response to the manipulation of the lncRNA levels was evaluated and we were able to identify genes that were activated or de-activated by each lncRNA. To understand how the lncRNAs could achieve these specific gene expression changes, we used a new technique to find protein interaction partners of RNAs. Together these data allowed us to create new hypotheses for the functions of the lncRNAs we investigated. We plan to continue to examine the roles and mechanisms of action of these long non-coding RNAs in controlling gene expression and cancer cell growth. Disrupting the production of these RNA molecules or manipulating their functions could allow us to slow or stop the growth of cancers in humans. We are applying for additional funding from the National Institutes of Health, the American Cancer Society, and the National Science Foundation using the preliminary data we have obtained from this study. We will continue to investigate how these RNAs interact with other molecules in the cell and plan to collaborate with nearby UC San Diego Chemistry and Biochemistry Department laboratories to develop therapeutics to manipulate the newly discovered RNA functions and help disrupt disease progression."

Cytotoxic chemotherapy alone has shown limited improvement in survival and immunotherapeutics have not shown great success in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRLM. While progress has been made in relevant research models, there is an unmet need to incorporate immune cell interactions into these models. Current ex-vivo oncologic models lack the milieu of non-cancerous components that influence a tumor including: 1) Primary colorectal cells do not survive in 2D cultures, 2) simple organoids do not adequately mimic essential features of the tumor microenvironment (TME) 3) murine models and patient-derived xenografts are costly and lack an intact immune response, and 4) syngeneic mouse models lack a human target and do not facilitate the development of the chronic inflammatory environment characteristic of human tumors, which can stimulate immunologic inhibitory pathways. 

The George laboratory has developed a novel autologous ex-vivo “tumor-on-a-chip” model, a microfluidic system of 3D human microtissues, in this case, fresh surgical specimens, perfused with a vascular network that recapitulate salient features of the cancer microenvironment including the relevant immune components. We have further refined and developed this model for patient-derived CRLM. We aim to demonstrate that our ex-vivo 3D chip mimics the immune and TME of CRLM patient avatars and will serve as a platform to study host immune cell-tumor interactions. We will test our hypothesis that MSS, RAS-wildtype (WT) CRLM respond to EGFR inhibitors and demonstrate an immune-rich TME compared to RAS mutant (MUT) tumors on the chip as seen in patients. In Aim 1 we will determine if molecular and immune phenotypes of RAS-WT and RAS-MUT CRLM are preserved on the 3D chip and comparable to surgical specimens. In Aim 2 we will test if ex-vivo responses to targeted therapy of RAS-WT and RAS-MUT CLRM on the 3D chip correlate with the clinical responses noted in individual patients’ tumors.

Leveraging such a system would allow for manipulation of the immune component, a critical step for developing more successful targeted and immunotherapeutic strategies for CRLM in a clinically relevant model.","In this project, we are trying to create a device (so called ex-vivo chip) which models the tumors outside the patient’s body to address a range of scientific questions; for example, the tumor’s response to a drug. Specifically, we aimed to characterize the tumor and the created 3D organoids to show that our platform mimics essential behaviors of a tumor. The ultimate goal is to use to our model as a platform to test immunotherapy and predict patient outcomes. 

Over the last year, we have made great progress towards both aims outlined in this project, however a major barrier was the laboratory shut down due to COVID-19 leading to decreased staffing, and lower numbers of elective cases to collect our samples. Major accomplishments include: 1. establishment of a protocol to synthesize 3D tumor organoids from freshly isolated tumor samples. 2. Refinement of our protocol to recover immune cells with high efficiency from patient matched blood samples at the time of surgery. 3. Learned to process both tumor and 3D organoids samples for single cell analysis and performed various stains to identify tumor cell, stromal cells, immune cells, and endothelial cell within the patient samples. 4. Created physiological flow conditions matching the capillaries to perfuse immune cells through our 3D chip. Our plan is to complete the experiments detailed in the initial grant with additional samples. 

The novelty of this project is that currently there is no ideal ex-vivo model which includes the patient’s tumor and entire microenvironment (including stromal, endothelial, and immune cells) to study the biology of a tumor. Our data so far show our ability to create patient specific tumor microenvironment on the chip and show the ability to capture patient matched immune cells on our device to study the interactions and drug responses of tumor and immune cells for future testing."

Curative intent external beam radiation therapy (RT) for PCa has been historically delivered in the form of low daily doses, or fractions, of RT over a total of 39 to 45 fractions. Because PCa cells appear to be preferentially killed by higher doses of RT per fraction (even if to a lower total overall dose), the modern technique of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) allows the treatment course to be condensed to as short as five fractions. However, while the rates of significant genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity are similar between SBRT and longer RT courses, it is unknown which patients are predisposed towards developing significant toxicity following either treatment. Given the higher doses per day delivered with SBRT, trepidation towards its use persist.
	Variants in germline DNA (i.e., DNA that is inherited and intrinsic to any given person) are thought to strongly influence a given patient's response to RT. We have significant data from a translational study of over 200 men that suggest that biomarker panels defined by single nucleotide polymorphisms in germline DNA predict significant genitourinary toxicity after longer-course RT or SBRT with a high level of accuracy. A practically relevant aspect of examining germline DNA is that any type of biological sample taken from a patient, such as an easily obtained cheek swab, would contain enough material for analysis.
	The project being proposed for a New Assistant Professor Faculty Seed Grant from the University of California Cancer Research Coordinating Committee is an innovative prospective clinical trial termed the “Germline DNA-Based Radiosensitivity Biomarker Influence on Decisions About and Toxicity Following Prostate Radiotherapy” (GARUDA) trial. This trial is designed to validate the germline predictors of toxicity we have identified, thereby establishing the ability to identify predictors of radiotherapy before RT. If validated in this prospective study, these germline predictors would have significant implications for the large number of patients who are pursuing RT for their PCa. Specifically, it would increase the confidence of both the patient and the physician that the expected rate of significant toxicity would be low.","Overall, this project, entitled “Germline DNA-based Biomarkers of Toxicity Following Prostate Radiotherapy”, was aimed to evaluate whether a panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms detected in germline DNA will identify patients at high risk of developing significant late genitourinary toxicity after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer. The overall goal of this research that by allowing patients and physicians to better estimate a patient’s risk of toxicity before treatment, more educated decisions about treatment options can be made. This, in term, will ultimately lead to reduced rates of significant toxicity for all patients receiving SBRT for prostate cancer.

The grant supported a phase II clinical trial, entitled “Germline DNA-Based Radiosensitivity Biomarker Influence on Toxicity Following Prostate Radiotherapy, GARUDA Trial (GARUDA)” (NCT04624256). Under the auspices of generous CRCC support, we launched and successfully completed this trial, which enrolled 200 patients.

This discipline is the study of how “spelling” mistakes in the RNA, rather than the DNA, contribute to cancer development. I will examine whether spelling mistakes in the RNA contribute to the development of a specific cancer, synovial sarcoma.
 
Synovial sarcomas are rare aggressive cancers of the muscle tissue that often affect adolescents and young adults. These cancers are invariably associated with an abnormality of chromosomes 18 and X (translocation t(X:18; p11:q11)), producing a chimeric protein SS18-SSX. While the presence of this chimeric protein ultimately results in abnormal gene regulation (how genes are turned on and turned off), the exact mechanism by which this occurs is still unknown.
 
Proteins that modify the sequence of RNA have recently emerged as an important class of gene regulators. They act at the level of RNA metabolism and translation and can affect the expression of cancer genes. However, the role of RNA modification defects in the development of synovial sarcoma is completely unknown. I hypothesize that abnormal modifications of the RNA contribute to the gene regulation changes that cause synovial sarcoma development. To address this hypothesis, I will examine the expression of RNA-modifying proteins in synovial sarcomas using the RNA sequence information from over 30 synovial sarcoma tumors, over 12,000 other cancers, and over 100 normal tissues that my laboratory previously assembled. I will then use a technology called nanopore direct RNA sequencing to characterize the landscape of RNA modifications in a panel of 30 synovial sarcoma tumor samples and patient-derived cell cultures. Finally, I will correlate the expression of RNA-modifying proteins to the catalog of RNA modifications to identify synovial sarcoma-specific patterns; I will use these patterns to develop further hypotheses about the role of RNA modifications in tumor development. The preliminary findings generated by this work will enable me to apply for larger grants to fund cancer epitranscriptomics research in my laboratory.","Cancer is a genetic disease, as it results from an accumulation of genetic changes (“spelling mistakes”) in the DNA of cells. These spelling mistakes are “expressed” as RNA and eventually make abnormal protein molecules that contribute to cancerous cell growth. However, cancers in young people have much fewer genetic changes in their DNA compared to cancers in older people. Therefore, other mechanisms beyond direct changes to the DNA must be contributing to young people’s cancers. 
This project explored the contributions to cancer development of one such mechanism, called “RNA modification”. RNA modifications could have profound effects on cancer cells, as they could alter which proteins are made by the cell and in what amount. However, studying RNA modifications has been challenging because of the lack of technologies that could directly detect chemical changes to the RNA. 
The goal of this project was to study RNA modifications in pediatric cancers for the first time, using a novel technology, called nanopore sequencing. Nanopore sequencing is a powerful technology that for the first time can determine the nucleotide composition of intact RNA molecules, thereby assessing their chemical modifications directly. This technology has never before been used to study RNA from pediatric cancers. 
Initially, I proposed to utilize the nanopore technology to study one type of pediatric cancer, synovial sarcoma. However, over the course of this project, we have realized that RNA modifications could be even more relevant to another difficult-to-treat pediatric cancer, high grade gliomas. As part of this project, we generated the first direct RNA sequencing data from both synovial sarcoma and pediatric high grade glioma. We successfully used the data to identify RNA modifications, and their detail analysis is currently ongoing.
This work has resulted in several grant submissions: Ford Foundation for Predoctoral Fellowship for Graduate Student Yvonne Vasquez and collaborative grant with Analiz Roriguez at University of Arkansas Medical Services. We also have a manuscript in preparation, which is expected to be published in 2023  to describe the results of this work."

While lacking a BCR-ABL fusion, nearly 65% of Ph-like ALL cases carry a rearrangement in the cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) gene located on both X and Y chromosomes, the most common being a chromosomal translocation with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (CRLF2-IgH) resulting in increased and uncontrolled expression of CRLF2 that correlates with reduced survival. CRLF2 rearrangements are significantly higher in patients of Latin descent, indicating this is a high-risk group for Ph-like ALL and that understanding the molecular mechanisms driving CRLF2 rearrangements would greatly benefit prediction and diagnosis of Ph-like ALL. Our recent analysis of over 2,000 translocation breakpoints in human patients revealed that DNA double-strand-breaks (DSBs) that initiate the CRLF2-IgH translocations can occur within a 25 kb region upstream of the gene but are enriched 36-fold in a 311 bp cluster region and involve the B cell-specific mutator activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Tight clustering of breakpoints indicates a non-random mechanism underlying DSB formation and elucidation of this mechanism would fill a crucial knowledge gap regarding the etiology of Ph-like ALL. Our central hypothesis is that CRLF2 DSBs occur through a defined mechanism that involves abnormal AID levels in an early pre-B cell stage and altered epigenetics that makes AID a more potent mutator and DSB initiator. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursing two specific aims: (1) Use our novel molecular assay to determine the mechanism of CRLF2-IgH translocations and (2) Compare the genomic DNA from B cells of Latino and non-Latino populations for genetic and epigenetic risk markers linked to CRLF2 rearrangements. This work is significant as it will this allow us to both address cancer disparities in the Latino community and develop novel diagnostics applicable to several B cell malignancies in wider population studies.","The Hispanic community is disproportionately affected by a blood cancer known as Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) that responds poorly to therapy and has low survival rates. The goals of this proposal were to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to this cancer and to use that information to develop diagnostic tools that will detect Ph-like ALL early in high-risk Hispanic patients. While Ph-like ALL is genetically heterogeneous, it has emerged that Hispanic patients are significantly more likely to have a t(X;14) translocation that replaces the CRLF2 promoter with the IgH promoter, which is constitutively active in B cells as it encodes the antibody heavy chain. High expression of CRLF2 provides a growth advantage as it activates the JAK/STAT pathway. This project funded by the UC CRCC had two major Aims: 1) To define the molecular mechanism of CRLF2-IgH rearrangements and 2) Determine the genetic and epigenetic factors underlying Ph-like ALL in Hispanics. For Aim 1, we were successful in developing a digital PCR (dPCR) assay that can quantify mutations related to DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation and repair in both European and Hispanic pre-B cell lines and in Hispanic patients treated at the UCI cancer center. The next step is to develop an assay that can specifically detect the t(X;14) translocation as an early prognostic of Ph-like ALL. For Aim 2, we have found that overexpression of a B cell specific mutator, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), increased the level of DSBs at not only CRLF2, but also other sites in the genome related to cancer etiology. We also found that one Hispanic ALL patient with an IgH translocation also had abnormally high AID expression in their circulating pre-B cells. We have also performed bisulfite sequencing in our different cell lines and found that hypo-methylation is related in increased AID targeting, providing an additional epigenetic marker for Ph-like ALL. Some hurdles to be overcome where obtaining patient samples due to the COVID epidemic, which taxed our healthcare system, but we anticipate an increase in patient samples in the coming year. Due to the preliminary data and success of this project, the research will continue and is currently funded by an NCI R37 MERIT award that is also associated with two NCI Diversity Supplements."

As a first step towards understanding CRC, it is crucial to understand the biology of the organ the cancer develops in. The inner mucosal layer of the intestine is comprised of an array of different epithelial cell types, which are organized in crypt structures. At the base of each crypt are non-quiescent epithelial stem cells that rapidly differentiate into progenitor cells. To determine how the transcriptome and proteome keep pace with rapid differentiation, we developed a new cell sorting method to purify mouse colon epithelial cells.  We showed that alternative pre-mRNA splicing and alternative polyadenylation dominate changes in the transcriptome as stem cells differentiate into progenitors. By contrast, as progenitors differentiate into mature cell types, changes in mRNA levels rather than different isoforms dominate the transcriptome. These observations demonstrated that during the first steps in loss of stemness, the most notable change in the transcriptome are changes in mRNA isoform production via alternative splicing events and/or alternative polyadenylation. Considering that the disruption of cellular differentiation and the promotion of rapid proliferation is a crucial step in initiating carcinogenesis, it is likely that CRC may originate from an inability of crypt stem cells to initiate the necessary alternative pre-mRNA processing programs that guide terminal differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesize that defects in alternative pre-mRNA processing contributes to the origin of CRC. To demonstrated that that the lack of differentiation-specific alternative pre-mRNA processing is an early hallmark of CRC, we plan to define the transcriptomes of colon stem cells and daughter cells harvested from a CRC mouse model. Furthermore, to demonstrate that equivalent alternative pre-mRNA processing changes accompany differentiation of human CRC cells, we will analyze the transcriptomes of CRC crypt organoids derived from human patients in the context of stemness and metabolically-induced differentiation. Throughout this project we will rely on our expertise in cancer biology, RNA biology, and bioinformatics to obtain new insights into gene expression patterns in CRC.","Alternative pre-mRNA processing is a hallmark of many colon cancer genes, suggesting that aberrant pre-mRNA processing may be beneficial for tumorigenesis.  We proposed to determine if defects in alternative pre-mRNA processing contribute to the origin of colorectal cancer.  The information obtained enables a more in-depth analysis identifying alternative processing signatures promoting tumor growth and progression.  

For Specific Aim 1 we tested the hypothesis that the lack of differentiation-specific alternative pre-mRNA processing is an early hallmark of colon cancer. We have used a mouse model recently described by our collaborator Dr. Selma Masri that is much more efficient in intestinal tumor formation. In addition to an APC mutation, these mice hold a mutation in a circadian clock gene.  Deep sequencing datasets of the mouse models were generated and analyzed for gene expression and alternative splicing changes. We produced transcriptome datasets from normal tissue, cancer tissue, and intestinal organoids. Comparison between our originally described differential splicing networks with the alternative splicing networks generated from the new datasets did not show significant overlaps in alternative splicing events, especially for the organoid cultures. While the new datasets were characterized by significant changes in alternative splicing just as was observed for the datasets discussed in our preliminary data, the overlap between specific events was limited. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that intestinal cancer-derived transcriptomes display differential splicing profiles when compared to wt counterparts. We conclude that cancer-specific alternative splicing networks largely lack the differentiation-specific alternative splicing characteristics. Our analysis also identified hnRNP A1 as a potential alternative splicing regulator mediating cancer-specific alternative splicing changes. 

For Specific Aim 2 we tested the hypothesis that differentiation of human colon cancer cells is accompanied by unique alternative pre-mRNA processing events. We had limited success in generating new datasets of CRC crypt organoids. By the end of the reporting period, we analyzed 6 organoid cultures from CRC patients and 6 healthy colon organoid cultures. Interestingly, we find several interesting parallels between CRC/healthy and stem cells/differentiated cells comparisons. In both scenarios, it appears that significant changes in alternative splicing are induced by alterations in splice patterns of general splicing factors. Thus, alternative exon inclusion in the loss of stemness process and the difference between cancer and healthy colon tissue is characterized by a large number of alternative splicing events, including events in splicing factors themselves. It is thus possible that the significant change in alternative splicing that is observed is triggered through indirect effects that stem from initial changes in proper splicing of general splicing factors. We are currently testing this exciting hypothesis as it may identify a focused set of splice factors as therapeutic targets that could reverse the proliferation capacity of colon cancer cells. Furthermore, the splicing regulator hnRNP was also highlighted in our analysis of human organoids. Future efforts will focus on evaluating the role of hnRNP A1 in mediating colon cancer initiation and progression."

Dysregulation of post-transcriptional control and translational machinery have been implicated in malignant tumor development. One of the mechanisms to govern translation is cytoplasmic polyadenylation, and recent evidence suggests that this process modulates gene reprogramming associated with cancer progression. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEB1-CPEB4) are sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins that act as a translational regulator to control poly(A) tail elongation of target mRNAs, and subsequently contribute to phenotypic changes in cancer cells. Among CPEBs, aberrant expression of CPEB3 has been shown in several types of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and glioma. Importantly, a self-cleaving hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme was identified in the CPEB3 gene. While we have previously uncovered the role of CPEB3 ribozyme in memory formation in mice, the regulation of CPEB3 ribozyme in transcriptional machinery implicated in cancer cells remains unexplored. Given the fact that CPEB3 acts as a tumor suppression gene, and downregulation of CPEB3 promotes cancer progression, we hypothesize that CPEB3 ribozyme might regulate CPEB3 expression and subsequently modulate tumorigenesis.  
In our preliminary studies from analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), we have found that CPEB3 expression is correlated with survival in low-grade glioma, melanoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. The proposed pilot study aims to elucidate whether the CPEB3 ribozyme plays a role in tumor development and progression.  In Aim 1: We will investigate CPEB3 ribozyme self-cleaving activity and identify whether the ribozyme facilitates full-length mRNA processing and protein expression in cancer cells. In Aim 2: We will determine tumor suppression effects of CPEB3 by inhibiting CPEB3 ribozyme, and understand the underlying mechanisms associated with cancer metastasis through post-transcriptional regulation by CPEB3. Our study will unveil the biological function of CPEB3 ribozyme in cancer, and provide insights into therapeutic interventions.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor in adults, with a poor prognosis that highlights a dire clinical need for innovative therapeutic interventions. Despite significant advances in diagnoses and multimodality therapies, the overall prognosis for patients with GBM remains poor, with a median survival time of 15-18 months. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need to develop alternative treatment strategies to improve clinical outcomes. Dysregulation of post-transcriptional control and translational machinery have been implicated in malignant tumor development. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEB1-CPEB4) are RNA-binding proteins that regulate poly(A) tail elongation of target mRNAs and subsequently contribute to phenotypic changes in cancer cells. Notably, a self-cleaving ribozyme was identified in the CPEB3 gene, but its role in cancer is wholly unexplored. Given that CPEB3 acts as a tumor suppressor gene and downregulation of CPEB3 promotes cancer progression, we hypothesize that CPEB3 ribozyme modulates CPEB3 expression and its activity results in tumor progression. Using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as an approach, we demonstrated that the locking CPEB3 ribozyme inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in GBM cell lines. This project provides an unusual opportunity to make significant headway toward deciphering the role of CPEB3 in cancer and potential treatment."

Leveraging TAM plasticity to promote pro-inflammatory functions holds great promise against tumors. However, the mechanisms that regulate TAM plasticity in vivo have not been studied extensively because of a dearth of appropriate mouse models. To fill this gap, we just generated a mouse strain that allows us to map the fate of IL12b-producing (pro-inflammatory) TAMs towards IL-10-producing (anti-inflammatory) ones. 
This application aims to use our new mouse strain to gain insights into the mechanisms of plasticity regulating the stability of the pro-inflammatory function of TAMs in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that the pro-inflammatory activity of TAMs can be induced by immunotherapy but is short-lived because the tumor microenvironment efficiently re-programs them to become anti-inflammatory. In Aim 1, we will determine the sequence and dynamics of TAM functional changes during the transition from pro- to anti-inflammatory. We will also explore the molecular mechanisms that might regulate the loss of the pro-inflammatory state in vivo by running RNA and ATAC sequencing on TAMs sorted based on their function. In Aim 2, we will measure TAM plasticity from pro- to anti-inflammatory phenotypes in tumors with varying degrees of immunogenicity and after the administration of various immune-stimulating therapies.  
The expected outcome of this project is to gain insight into the extent, duration, and potential mechanisms by which the tumor re-programs pro-inflammatory macrophages to become anti-inflammatory, supporting its progression. In the long term, the knowledge we generate will pave the way to new forms of cancer immunotherapy to perpetuate pro-inflammatory TAM functions.","Project overview: The objective of this CRCC grant was to study the dynamics and molecular determinants of the plastic conversion of pro-inflammatory tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to anti-inflammatory cells. To achieve this goal, we proposed to use our new transgenic mouse model (BRG) that allows labeling of IL-12-producing pro-inflammatory TAMs with a blue fluorescent protein, IL-10-producing anti-inflammatory TAMs with GFP, and also to map the fate of pro-inflammatory TAMs through the stable expression of the red fluorescent protein Tomato.
Progress towards completion of the Aims: We successfully used our BRG mice to determine the origin and lifespan of pro-inflammatory TAMs that turned anti-inflammatory because of plasticity. We also quantified the spontaneous TAM plasticity in immunogenic tumors and started investigating the factors that facilitate the generation of pro-inflammatory TAMs. Overall, we have completed 40% of Aim 1 and 60% of Aim 2. 
Obstacles: We faced one major problem. Suddenly, we became unable to detect GFP (reading out IL-10 production) in macrophages isolated from BRG mice. A key in vitro experiment indicated that macrophages from BRG mice retained their ability to produce IL-10, but they did not co-express GFP. We suspect the occurrence of a germline mutation abolishing GFP expression in macrophages. We solved this problem by generating a new mouse colony to map the fate of pro-inflammatory TAMs towards anti-inflammatory / tissue-remodeling functions, read out by an Arginase 1 YFP transgene (BRY mice). Colony replacement made us lose a lot of time.
Major findings: We have determined that IL-10-producing anti-inflammatory TAMs do not originate from a population of committed monocytes. Within the tumor environment, TAMs acquire anti-inflammatory functions at least in part because of the plastic conversion of pro-inflammatory TAMs, and have a short lifespan of approximately one week. We also determined that tumor immunogenicity is a crucial determinant of pro-inflammatory TAM generation during tumor progression.
Continuation of research: We are requesting a no-cost extension to carry out the RNA sequencing experiments on pro-inflammatory and fate-mapped TAMs. These crucial experiments will allow us to identify the molecular determinants of pro-inflammatory TAM function and plasticity away from it."

IDH mutant gliomas are for the most part distinct from glioblastomas, a type of diffuse glioma that is the most common adult brain cancer.  IDH mutant gliomas can be further separated into astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas based on the absence or presence, respectively, of the 1p19q chromosomal co-deletion.  IDH mutant astrocytomas are ~2-3 times more common than oligodendrogliomas.  The process of malignant transformation [2], albeit poorly defined and characterized, represents a common transition  in which low grade gliomas adopt a more aggressive and treatment resistant phenotype, ultimately leading to death.  Malignant transformation is diminished or significantly delayed in many oligodendroglioma patients, and as a result, many but not all, oligodendroglioma patients treated with radiation and chemotherapy can experience long survivals approximating cure.  This is not the case for the majority of astrocytoma patients.  While astrocytomas can be controlled for intervals ranging from 5-15 years, almost inevitably, astrocytomas will undergo malignant transformation becoming more aggressive and treatment resistant.   With improved understanding of the process of malignant transformation, we expect to be able to predict and ultimately prevent malignant transformation.  Specifically, we will examine the role of recently available IDH mutant inhibitors now in trials for glioma [3] in altering malignant transformation and whether IDH mutant inhibition has a role in gliomas post malignant transformation.  The anticipated approach will be multidisciplinary involving neuro-oncology, neuro-imaging, neurosurgery, and molecular pathology and tumor biology all focused on leveraging the large numbers of IDH mutant patients cared for by the UCLA Neuro-oncology.  Over the past 4 months, we have identified >800 IDH mutant patients and begun collecting and organizing clinical, pathological, imaging and tissue resources. We will pursue the following aims: 1) identify predictors of malignant transformation of IDH mutant gliomas,  2) characterize the effect of IDH mutant inhibition on patient gliomas both before and after malignant transformation, and 3) explore mechanisms of malignant transformation in vivo and in vitro.","The process of malignant transformation (MT) is poorly understood in IDHMUT lower-grade gliomas.  In this proposal, we investigate the central hypothesis that prevention of MT will result in improved outcomes for IDHMUT glioma patients.   These studies are necessary to determine the impact of newly- FDA approved oral IDH inhibitors on MT and whether they have a role in gliomas post-MT.  Accordingly, we pursued the aims of the project: Aim 1:  To identify predictors of malignant transformation of IDHMUT gliomas, and Aim 2:  To explore mechanisms of malignant transformation of IDHMUT gliomas in vitro.  For Aim 1, which consists of retrospective analysis of the UCLA patient experience with IDH mutant gliomas, we have made substantial progress in identifying and curating a list of >900 IDH mutant glioma patients for which these is a rich set of corresponding clinical, pathological (histological, molecular, and genetic), and imaging data to correlate with development of malignant transformation.  Because not all patients have undergone additional surgeries enabling path confirmation of MT, we have also scored all patients for the development of new contrast enhancement on imaging as a surrogate marker for MT.   In doing so, we have expanded the total number of patients undergoing MT.  We have developed visualization schemes utilizing detailed ‘swimmer’s plots’ and ‘oncoplots’ for easy to grasp snapshots of the differences in MT under different treatment conditions.   For Aim 2, has expectedly been more challenging, we have not yet been able to derive true low grade glioma models via conventional gliomasphere culture conditions.  Thus far, we have promising results in which gliomaspheres grow more readily if an IDH mutant inhibitor is added in, confirming other data that D2-HG is growth suppressant.  More recently, we have begun a collaboration with Dr. Zhaohui Wang at the Terasaki Institute in Woodland Hills, in which fresh patient glioma samples are processed into microorganoids which enable early visualization of cellular growth, microenvironment and response to treatment.   We are continuing these studies and are in the process of preparing several manuscripts and a multi-year NIH grant."

Adherence to general healthy dietary recommendations, e.g., achieving a healthy body weight, being physically active, and following a dietary pattern rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, has been associated with improved survival and health-related quality of life in cancer survivors. However, previous studies have found low adherence to these guidelines in cancer survivors. Dietary recommendations designed specifically for cancer patients are often based on inclusive, conflicting, or non-existing medical evidence, which is the primary source of confusion and frustration. We intend to design a randomized controlled trial which is an individualized diet-related small habits (DISHs) intervention program for cancer survivors. In the main trial, individual-tailed DISHs will be proposed based on an assessment of DISH perceptions, diet and nutrition status, demographics, and environmental information. The personalized intervention will be implemented remotely through a smartphone App. As more data is collected by the App to train machine learning algorithms (MLA) models, the DISHs intervention will be further modulated individually to increase adherence. The objective of the current study is to examine the feasibility of the main trial. In this study, we will estimate the capability of recruitment of CCCS (clinically cured cancer survivors) in communities through different sources; evaluate questionnaires for measuring DISHs perception and collecting of data that are associated with barriers to unhealthy dietary behaviors; assess questionnaires for measuring adherence of DISHs; investigate the approach to collect biological specimens; evaluate the performance of training the MLA models for personalized DISHs; and ultimately estimate the cost, time and manpower as a whole. The results of this feasibility study will provide solid evidence to design the main trail at the next stage.","Our study focuses on developing a diet-related small habit (DISH) intervention program for cancer survivors, using a smart-phone based apps that remotely guide cancer survivors manage their dietary behaviors more effectively. The aim of this feasibility study is to develop a questionnaires to assess DISH perceptions and adherence, shape the app prototype, determine relevant study outcomes, and estimate the costs associated with implementing the intervention program.

Progress Toward Research Goals:
Significant progress has been made on several aspects. We have successfully developed a questionnaire designed to gauge perceptions of and adherence to the DISH. Content validity, face validity and test-retest reliability were evaluated by an expert panel and a pilot study. Additionally, we have started the survey using the DISH questionnaire and the development of the DISH mobile app, characterized as an AI assistant, which will eventually be tailored to individual users with personalized experience.

Barriers Encountered:
Our progress experienced some delays due to unforeseen circumstances. The PhD student who was crucial to the project took maternity leave, and another student who was expected to contribute to the app’s development left the team because of graduation. Despite these challenges, we have made steady progress with the resources available.

Major Accomplishments:
1.DISH Questionnaire Development for the survey: We have completed the creation of a comprehensive questionnaire to evaluate users' perceptions, acceptance, and adherence to the DISH.
2.App Development: Initial development of the DISH app has begun, incorporating the evidence and feedback gathered from our ongoing studies.
Plans for Continuation:

We will continue refining the DISH app using data collected from ongoing studies. We aim to finalize the app prototype and continue the survey using DISH questionnaire in the coming weeks. Additionally, we will develop a detailed budget to support future funding applications and planning for the intervention study.

Distinction from Other Funding:
Our study specifically supports the development and evaluation of DISHs, an electronic tool tailored to develop small dietary behaviors in cancer survivors. We aim to translate dietary guideline to a practical approach for healthy dietary behaviors intervention in cancer survivors."

Relapsed/refractory T-ALL is often enriched with leukemia initiating cells (LICs), which exhibit enhanced survival and self-renewal capacity. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) plays a key regulatory role in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, the innate immune response, and cancer. We discovered that ADAR1-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is crucial for the maintenance of T-ALL LIC. Preliminary studies revealed that approximately 70% of T-ALL patients exhibit high expression of ADAR1, and this is associated with significantly worse clinical outcome. In addition, inhibition of ADAR1 impairs LIC survival and self-renewal in patient-derived in vitro and in vivo models. An important function of A-to-I RNA editing is to suppress interferon (IFN)-induced apoptosis by dsRNA sensing and to prevent activation of the innate immune response. Inosine-containing endogenous dsRNA is recognized as “self” by dsRNA-sensing pathways to distinguish from invading viral dsRNA. In this manner, ADAR1 prevents activation of dsRNA sensors, such as melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and protein kinase R (PKR), which in turn trigger inflammation signals. We were excited to confirm that ADAR1 suppresses inflammation pathways by limiting the cytosolic dsRNA pool in T-ALL LICs. This occurs through both hyper-editing of IFN-associated RNAs and retention of nuclear dsRNA via an RNA editing-independent mechanism. However, whether the ADAR1-directed, dsRNA-sensing pathway contributes to LIC maintenance has never been studied. To test this, we will first determine if ADAR1 knockdown activates aberrant dsRNA sensing by quantifying the level and cellular location of dsRNA. In addition, concurrent knockdown of dsRNA sensors (PKR and MDA5) in combination with ADAR1 knockout in LICs will be applied to determine if aberrant dsRNA sensing disrupts LIC self-renewal in patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, we will map dsRNA-containing genes suppressed by either RNA editing or dsRNA binding activity of ADAR1. Together, these studies will establish whether the cellular functions of ADAR1 in LICs depend on the suppression of dsRNA-sensing pathways.","An emerging research topic in cancer is the identification of RNA modifying enzymes that may cooperate with genetic lesions to provide advantages in important leukemia functions.  ADAR1-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing plays a key regulatory role in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, innate immune response, and cancer. ADAR1-directed RNA editing negatively regulates interferon (IFN) production and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) activation by preventing accumulation of endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which are detected by the MDA5-MAVS dsRNA sensing pathway. However, dsRNA sensing of immunostimulatory transcripts as a mechanism in ADAR1-regulated LIC self-renewal has never been fully characterized. The overall research progress focus on the role of ADAR1-mediated dsRNA sensng and A-to-I RNA editing landsape in regulation leukemia initiating cell in pediatric T-ALL. 
We have established a fundamental role of malignant ADAR1 activation in T-ALL LIC self-renewal via attenuating dsRNA sensing. Furthermore, these data suggests that T-ALL LIC self-renewal rely entirely on the p150-MDA5 axis in T-ALL with high expression of MDA5. T-ALL models with low intrinsic MDA5 levels may utilize both p150 and p110 isoforms in an MDA5- dependent and -independent manner to promote self-renewal. It is possible that LICs possess different levels of dependency on the ADAR1-MDA5 pathway due to the diverse ISG signatures and IFN signaling in patients with T-ALL. With the support of CRCC, our group have successfully competed for several external fundings, including a NCI R01 and a R03 (PI Jiang). Dr. Jiang were also able to present these data in two local meetings. Future studies will focus on investigate the dependency of ADAR1 p150 isoform and p110 isoforms on T-ALL LICs by directly genetic deletion. We will also examine the overall RNA editing landscape in pediatric leukemia with the goal to discover new therapeutics in these deadly diseases"

Treatment requires intensive chemotherapy, months-long hospitalization, and often bone marrow transplant. Despite this, relapses are common, and cure after relapse is rare. Better therapies for AML are sorely needed. Because we have reached the limit of what conventional approaches can offer, progress will depend on our discovering new, biologically rational approaches to this disease. 

We have chosen to approach this problem systematically by surveying the entire genome for new ways to kill AML cells. Virtually every form of cancer therapy kills tumor cells using a common biochemical pathway called apoptosis. Cancer drugs cause some form of cellular damage or stress, and this triggers the process of apoptosis to kill the cell. A gene called TP53 plays an important role in this process. TP53 acts as a sensor of cellular injury, and it triggers apoptosis when damage reaches a certain threshold. Mutations that disable TP53 make cells less prone to apoptosis, allowing them to persist despite treatment. TP53 mutations are therefore highly associated with relapse in AML and most other forms of cancer.

We reason that new therapies might emerge from a broad survey of apoptosis regulation across the genome. We have conducted preliminary experiments studying a different type of cancer (rhabdomyosarcoma). We adapted cutting-edge CRISPR technology to identify genes that regulate BIM, one of several key proteins involved in the apoptosis process. Having validated this approach, we now plan to study AML with a broader version of this novel technology.

With recent advances, we are now poised to study multiple proteins that work together in apoptosis. Some promote cell death (BAD, BID, BIM, and BAX), while others are protective (BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL1). Studying this protein family as a whole will be more useful than focusing on BIM alone, because apoptosis reflects the combined action of these components. In essence, we will identify pathways that increase pro-death proteins and reduce survival proteins in a panel of AML cell lines. By comparing cells that have a mutation in TP53 to cells with normal TP53, we will discover ways to trigger apoptosis regardless of TP53 status. This will suggest potential new therapies for the most difficult, resistant forms of AML.","This project focuses on myeloid leukemia (AML). It seeks to understand what makes leukemia cells live or die and to identify novel ways to trigger their death. We focus on cases where the TP53 gene is mutated, because this is a major cause of resistance to chemotherapy. We used a genetic tool called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) study regulation of cell death. This technique can systematically turn off specific genes. This works well in cell lines, which are cultures of cancer cells that grow continuously in the lab. We set out to use CRISPRi in AML cell lines to determine which genes can trigger cell death, even when TP53 is mutated. We have made substantial progress. First, we mutated the TP53 gene in each of three different AML cell lines, creating pairs of cell lines that differ only by TP53 status. These cell line pairs will allow us to compare cell death regulation in normal vs. TP53 mutated cells. They are a valuable resource that we have already shared with collaborators. Next, we introduced a CRISPRi library – a collection manipulating thousands of genes, one by one – into two of these cell line pairs. From each cell population, we isolated cells having high or low levels of seven key proteins that control cell death. We are now processing DNA purified from these samples to learn how each gene in the CRISPRi library affects each of the seven proteins. We also encountered some challenges. One cell line was difficult to modify with CRISPRi, leaving us with two pairs. We also experienced problems with DNA purification. Our method preserves cells using formaldehyde, which can sometimes damage DNA. In this experiment, because we had many samples to collect, the storage times were extended for some samples. In retrospect, we now feel this led excessive DNA damage from prolonged formaldehyde exposure. We have since isolated adequate DNA from all samples, and we will avoid prolonged storage in future experiments. We are also testing alternative preservatives that spare DNA, and if these are successful, this will represent a technical contribution to the field. Overall, our major accomplishment so far is creating three pairs of AML cell lines that differ only in TP53 status. We will continue processing our samples, and in the coming months we expect to achieve the main goal of this project: finding genes that can promote cell death without relying on TP53."

GLDC function is critical to tumor-initiating cells in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and it has been proposed as a promising drug target for lung cancer treatment. In spite of the urgent need to develop new lung-cancer chemotherapeutics, currently there is no GLDC inhibitor available that could allow researchers to validate the hypothesis regarding GLDC as an anti-cancer drug target. In this project, we aim to bridge this knowledge gap to develop the first GLDC-selective inhibitor(s). First, we will design mechanism-based inhibitors by harnessing the unique reactivity of aminooxy group towards PLP cofactor and mimicking GLDC’s unique substrate, lipoylated H-protein. We will use a “cap-linker-binder” modular approach to rapidly create a library of aminooxy-based inhibitors and map out the structure-activity relationship. Secondly, to further improve this first-generation of GLDC inhibitors, we will use a structure-guided approach. Since crystal structures of human GLDC are available, we will leverage the existing structure-determination protocols to study the crystal structure of GLDC-inhibitor complex. Moreover, as the protein-protein interaction between GLDC and H-protein is unknown, we will also use affinity-probe and chemoenzymatically modify H-protein in order to stabilize the GLDC-H protein complex for structural characterization. This co-crystal structure will provide critical insights for designing peptide inhibitors that can block the substrate entrance tunnel of GLDC. Furthermore, the approach also provides an opportunity to develop protein-protein interaction inhibitor or molecular glue-like inhibitors. Thirdly, as a complementary approach, we will also perform a phenotypical screening experiment to identify drug leads de novo. For example, we will use the phage-display technique to screen a large library of cyclic peptides and identify the initial peptide scaffolds or sequences that can bind to GLDC and also inhibit its activity. We expect our study will provide new mechanistic insights for modulating GLDC activity, provide the first-in-class GLDC inhibitors, and pave the way for future in vivo study and pre-clinical investigations.","This project aimed to develop inhibitors targeting glycine decarboxylase, which is a promising anti-cancer drug target. We have worked on the synthesis of the designed inhibitors. Despite that the student and postdoc scholars who were leading this project encountered some difficulty in the efforts in assaying the enzyme activities, we were able to use enzymes to synthesize natural products with promising anticancer activity, including swainsonine, a compound isolated from Darling Peas and some types of fungi that shows potent inhibition to alpha-D-mannosidase. The discovery and elucidation of this important anticancer product enabled future biosynthesis of diverse alkaloids with complementary selective inhibition to different glycosidases, facilitating the development of new anti-cancer chemotherapeutics."

They exert such pleiotropic effects by entering their target cells and activating intracellular nuclear receptors. Due to their lipophilic character, steroid hormones are believed to freely diffuse across cellular membranes in process called simple diffusion. Despite its frequent appearance in physiology textbooks, however, this model has never been experimentally demonstrated in any organism. Indeed, recent studies in our lab have shown that ecdysone, the primary steroid hormone in insects, requires membrane transporters to traverse the plasma membrane. These transporters, named ecdysone importers, all belong to the solute carrier organic anion (SLCO) transporter superfamily, which is highly conserved among metazoans including humans.
In the proposed project, we aim to identify potential roles of SLCO transporters in androgen-dependent prostate cancer growth. In preliminary studies, we identified one SLCO transporter that is primarily responsible for testosterone incorporation into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, challenging the conventional paradigm that human steroid hormones are incorporated into cells by simple diffusion. As this SLCO is highly expressed in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells whose growth is androgen dependent, we will knock out this SLCO-encoding gene in LNCaP cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique and test if their testosterone-dependent growth is significantly affected. We will also examine potential effects of known SLCO inhibitors on the testosterone-dependent growth of LNCaP, aiming to establish a proof of concept that androgen-dependent prostate cancer growth can be pharmacologically manipulated by targeting membrane transporters involved in androgen incorporation.","The overarching goal of this project was to characterize functions of a membrane transporter named solute carrier organic anion transporter 4A1 (SLCO4A1) in androgen incorporation into prostate cancer cells. Previous studies in the Principal Investigator’s laboratory have shown that SLCO transporters are involved in the cellular incorporation of the insect steroid hormone ecdysone, suggesting that human SLCOs may also facilitate cellular uptake of mammalian steroid hormones, such as androgens. Our preliminary study indeed demonstrated that SLCO4A1 knockout (KO) human cells show lower testosterone response as assessed by the NanoBiT assay, a method that detects dimerization of transfected androgen receptor (AR) proteins in response to testosterone binding. We therefore proposed that we would work on a prostate cancer cell line where SLCO4A1 is highly expressed and demonstrate the potential role of SLCO4A1 in testosterone incorporation into cancer cells.
Upon further working on the SLCO4A1-KO cell line, however, we realized that the endogenous AR gene expression is significantly upregulated in those mutant cells. This seemingly led to more interactions between the endogenous vs transfected AR proteins, which artificially lowered the detectable response of SLCO4A1-KO cells to testosterone in the NanoBiT assay. We therefore took an alternative approach to identify transporter-encoding genes responsible for steroid hormone incorporation, using a mutagenesis-based selection technique in cultured human cells. Although we ended up taking a different approach, we took advantage of this financial support to meet the goal of identifying membrane transporters that are responsible for steroid hormone incorporation into cancer cells. The selection-based screening of transporter-encoding genes is currently underway."

Stress also increases tumor progression by activating beta-adrenergic receptors causing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, promoting tumor cell invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Interfering with beta-adrenergic signaling inhibits tumor proliferation and survival. Epidemiological studies revealed that subjects who received beta-adrenergic antagonists for stress reduction showed a lower cancer rate. Combining beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists with the current standard of care therapies creates potent synergism leading to tumor remission. Beta-adrenergic receptors are highly expressed in glioblastomas (GBM) and correlate with poor prognosis.
Preliminary results: Significant cell death occurs by beta2 receptor antagonism and disruption of primarily the beta2-arrestin pathway in three glioma cell lines. Selective beta2-antagonist, ICI 118551 showed, while biased G-protein agonist Salmeterol xinafoate revealed the highest efficacy. Zinterol, a balanced agonist (leading to activation of both G-protein and Beta-arrestin pathways), showed no cell death. Anti-apoptotic protein survivin was downregulated by beta-2-adrenergic signaling interference by salmeterol xinafoate. We hypothesize that (1) disruption of the beta-2-adrenergic signaling or ablation of the beta-2-adrenergic receptor promotes cell death of GBMs/tumorigenesis. (2) The mechanism of GBM death by interfering with beta-2-adrenergic signaling caused by loss of survivin leads to activating proapoptotic caspases.
Aim 1: Determine if tumorigenesis/survival of GBM tumors is dependent on beta-2-Adrenergic receptors. In floxed beta-2-Adrenergic receptor mice, the endogenous neural progenitors will be driven to become gliomas by stereotactic injection of retroviruses expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B and Cre recombinase-estrogen receptor. Only in glioma tumors will beta2-adrenergic receptors be knockout by tamoxifen treatment to test the hypothesis that the resulting tumors could be spatially/temporally regressed by losing their beta-2-AR.
Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the cellular mechanisms by which loss of- or beta-2-AR-function causes cell death is through downregulation of survivin expression with subsequent activation of caspases.","The overarching view of this project is to determine whether beta2-adrenergic receptors expressed in glioblastoma tumors are responsible for initiating these tumors and whether these receptors are essential for tumor survival. The project is based on the premise that beta-blockers inhibit the proliferation and survival of several types of cancer and lower cancer incidence for patients on beta-blocker prescriptions. We have finished the design and the construction of the retrovirus plasmid and infected mouse cancer cells with this retrovirus, and we have shown that the cells express the oncogene and are tamoxifen-inducible. We show the knockdown of protein kinase called G-protein coupled receptor kinase-6, responsible for the phosphorylation of beta2-adrenergic receptors to attract beta-arrestin, is essential for proliferation and survival for two glioma cell lines. My lab achieved experiments at basal levels of receptor activity. As planned, we will experiment with an agonist, zinterol, and a biased agonist, isoetharine. In addition, combined with the work before funding this grant and after funding, we show that interference with beta2-adrenergic receptors results in cell death and that biased agonist salmeterol xinafoate degrades the survivin protein. The overarching barrier we are overcoming is initiating the intracranial glioma mouse model.

This oncogenic retrovirus can splice out beta2-adrenergic receptors during tamoxifen treatment. (2) Proliferation and survival of glioma cells appear to depend on the beta-arrestin pathway. (3) Disruption of the beta2-adrenergic receptors results in death of glioma cells and degradation of survivin. We submitted an NIH R21 grant application in June to continue this research."

A hallmark of cancer cells and major driver of the cancer cell evolution that results in proliferation mis-regulation and metastasis is loss of genetic stability. A major factor in loss of genetic stability is an increase in mitotic errors, which results in aneuploidy. As forces produced by mitotic motors are central to high mitotic fidelity in normal cells, full elucidation of the biochemical activities of human mitotic motors promises to provide insights into how high chromosome separation fidelity is achieved in healthy cells and is lost in cancer cells.  Moreover, because cancer cell pathogenesis depends on mis-regulated proliferation, and because cancer cells exhibit enhanced sensitivity to mitotic inhibitors relative to normal cells, newly discovered mitotic motor activities are promising targets for development of new cancer therapies.  Indeed, anti-mitotic compounds such as taxol are highly effective clinically. However, these anti-mitotics are dose-limited because they are not specific to mitotic cells.  Here, we propose to adopt for human mitotic motors, a powerful biochemical assay system developed and used successfully in the applicant’s lab to identify new activities for yeast mitotic motors.  This research will build a foundation for future studies to test the hypothesis that these mitotic motor activities are aberrant in certain cancers, and for development of biochemical assays designed to identify novel inhibitors of human mitotic motors for cancer chemotherapy. Such inhibitors would offer a larger therapeutic window than cancer drugs like taxol that target tubulin, because tubulin is not only present in mitotic spindles, but plays sundry roles in every cell in the body and is particularly crucial for function of neurons.","Mitotic motor proteins generate forces on and within mitotic spindles to faithfully separate chromosomes at each cell division, ensuring genetic continuity necessary for normal health.

We sought to fully elucidate the biochemical activities of human mitotic motors to achieve a deeper understanding of how high chromosome separation fidelity is lost in cancer cells. Newly discovered mitotic motor activities are promising targets for development of new cancer therapies. We previously developed a powerful reconstitution assay to identify the force generation mechanisms and proteins that drive mitosis in budding yeast cells. We realized that extension of this assay to human cells could offer a unique opportunity to attack cancer cells where the force-generating motors become disregulated, making such cancer cells highly susceptable to perturbation by motor protein inhibition. Whereas it is relatively easy and inexpensive to grow large masses of yeast cells to generate cell extracts of high protein concentration for our assay, a major challenge was to obtain such large amounts of human cells. We succeeded in doing this using spinner culture in which the cells are grown in suspension and collected by centrifugation.  Through trial and error, we succeeded in obtaining large masses of human cells, which were concentrated by centrifugation.  We introduced a fluorescent tag for microtubules into the human cell extract and observed robust human microtubule assembly and growth.  We are now testing for the presence and movement of kinetochores driven by human motor proteins.  This research will be extended in future studies to identify mitotic motor activities that are aberrant in certain cancers and will find small molecule inhibitors for cancer chemotherapy. Such inhibitors promise a larger therapeutic window than cancer drugs like taxol that target tubulin."

These memory T cells stand poised to recognize the virus and fight subsequent infection with the same virus. In order to provide optimal protection, memory T cells patrol the body and look for infected cells by examining whether cells have viral pieces, or peptides, on the cell surface. For example, memory T cells that have formed during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic can recognize pieces of the spike peptide of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Spike-specific memory T cells will kill any cell that expresses viral spike proteins.

Recent findings have shown that memory T cells even patrol tumor tissue. Of course, since tumor cells are not infected with virus, the virus-specific memory T cells that patrol tumor tissue will not harm the tumor cells. Our preliminary studies have found that administration of viral peptides into tumor tissue will make tumors resemble virus-infected cells, resulting in activation of virus-specific memory T cells that can kill the tumor; however, the effect is transient since the viral peptides undergo rapid degradation and clearance. If this response can be augmented and sustained, it could represent an innovative non-toxic approach to tumor immune therapy.

In order to make tumor cells resemble infected cells, we propose to deliver self-amplifying mRNA vaccines into the tumor. These vaccines, similar to Moderna or Pfizer’s mRNA vaccines, will result in the production of spike peptides by tumor cells, rendering them immunogenic. Anti-COVID-19 responses will be directed towards the tumor and release tumor antigens to prime tumor-specific responses. We will test our approach using mouse models of viral infection and blood from COVID-19 patients known to have memory T cells specific for spike peptides. If successful, our approach could work in a majority of the world’s population given the incredible T cell memory that has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.","1) This project aims to provide proof-of-concept that using self-amplifying messenger RNA (saRNA) vaccines can promote immunity to tumors. The idea is that vaccines that encode for viral antigens, such as the spike protein from SARS-COV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), can be taken up by tumor cells and make the tumor cells resemble infected cells. T cells that recognize spike protein will then kill the tumor cells, leading to productive tumor immunity. The project will test the idea with an animal model using LCMV (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) glycoprotein as a model viral antigen (Aim 1) and a cell culture model using blood samples from individuals known to have been infected with SARS-COV-2 and with symptoms of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). 2) progress was made largely in the animal model to examine the uptake and expression of saRNA molecules, confirming their extended expression of the antigen. 3) A major barrier was in producing enough lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for immunization. A second barrier was that LNPs did not seem to be taken up well by tumor cells. 4) Major accomplishments include a) demonstration that LNP-saRNA can produce sustained expression of a reporter antigen in an animal model; b) demonstration that LNPs may not be taken up well by tumor cells; c) demonstration that saRNA molecules can be transfected into tumor cells and result in sustained expression of viral antigen; d) demonstration that CD8 memory T cells specific for spike antigens have variable frequency in individuals with COVID-19. 5) Plans for continuation include a) testing LNPs for ability to induce anti-viral immunity in vivo once they have been produced by an outside vendor; b) testing tumor immunity in vivo of tumor cells transfected with saRNA encoding viral antigens; c) examining efficacy of LNP-saRNAs in inducing tumor-immunity."
,C24CR7667,Awarded,Small Molecule Immuno-Oncology: Mechanism-based Inactivators of IL4I1 and AHR-Driven Cancers,Cancer Research Coordinating Committee,CRCC 2023-24 - Faculty Seed Grants,Faculty Seed Grants,79500,2023-10-01,2025-09-30,Michael Pirrung,michael.pirrung@ucr.edu,"University of California, Riverside",,Faculty Seed Grants,,"A major advance in cancer treatment has been checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda, an antibody that overcomes evasion of the local immune response to a tumor by inhibiting interactions of a molecule called PD-L1. Like many cancer treatments, effective responses are observed in only a minority of patients. Another way tumors suppress the immune response in their local environment is producing tryptophan metabolites via the kynurenine pathway. One of its enzymes is indole dioxygenase (IDO), for which inhibitors/drug candidates have been developed (epacadostat, indoximod). These entered clinical study, often combined with checkpoint inhibitors. For the most part, these have not shown desired efficacy, and IDO inhibitors have lost their luster.

Understanding of how tryptophan metabolites suppress the immune response has recently expanded. Their activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in T-cells is key. Tryptophan-derived indole-3-pyruvate is a strong AHR activator. The enzyme that produces them is IL4I1. There is a greater correlation of immune suppression by a tumor to indole-3-pyruvate levels than kynurenic acid levels (a product of IDO), and only IL4I1 is needed to make indole-3-pyruvate. Therefore, IL4I1 is a more relevant target to the desired drug effect, overcoming tumor immune evasion. Activation of the AHR in tumor cells also stimulates their proliferation. So preventing AHR activator production has two benefits. 

The enzymatic mechanism of IL4I1 includes an essential flavin cofactor. Inhibitors of flavin enzymes have a long history in biochemistry. One particularly fruitful approach to targeting them is a classical, now almost forgotten strategy, mechanism-based inhibition. “Suicide inhibitors” typically lead to irreversible covalent enzyme modification. There are marketed drugs with this mode of action against flavin enzymes. While covalent drugs are currently fashionable, and also have success stories in cancer (like ibrutinib), there are distinct advantages to mechanism-based inhibitors. They must be acted upon by the enzyme to reveal a reactive functionality, providing very high specificity. We will take this approach to inhibiting IL4I1 that draws from a vast past literature on mechanism-based inhibition. An effective inhibitor of IL4I1 would be a worthy candidate to study in combination with checkpoint inhibitors for immuno-oncology.","At least two signaling pathways enable immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment: the PD-1 checkpoint and the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. The latter produces small molecule activators of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which also promote tumor survival. This project will discover small molecules that suppress the KYN pathway by inhibiting its key enzyme target, IL4I1, and enhance the effect of checkpoint inhibitors.

This project has made minimal progress because of a lack of personnel, and as a consequence essentially none of the funds have been expended. The plan for continuation of the project is identical to the plan to pursue it, simply beginning now, since the hiring of postdoctoral fellows to do the work."

Despite great success in other cancers, current immunotherapies have shown minimal efficacy in human OSA, underscoring the need for novel immunotherapies for these aggressive cancers. Dogs are outbred companion animals that develop spontaneous cancers in the setting of an intact immune system, allowing for the study of complex immune interactions during cancer therapies while also addressing endpoints of efficacy and toxicity. Importantly, dog OSA shows remarkable homology to human OSA. We have exciting data that a subset of dogs with bulky pulmonary metastases from OSA can show tumor regression after only 14 days of inhaled recombinant human (rh) IL-15, including dogs with dramatic responses lasting 1 year. However, we have also observed that if we administer rhIL-15 after surgery in an earlier stage of disease, rhIL-15 is ineffective and appears to worsen outcomes, suggesting a tumor-promoting effect of rhIL-15 in the post-surgical setting. We now have provocative preliminary data that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) express the IL15 receptor alpha (IL15RA), suggesting these immunosuppressive cells may be able to sequester IL-15 and limit the anti-tumor activity of natural killer (NK) and memory T cells. Since surgery is known to induce IL-6, TGF-beta, and GM-CSF secretion, which all promote MDSC expansion, we hypothesize a link between surgery, MDSC expansion, and resistance to IL-15 immunotherapy. 

We will evaluate our hypothesis with the following specific aims:

Aim 1: Evaluate circulating MDSC levels post-surgery, hypothesizing an MDSC expansion triggered by increases in myelopoiesis cytokines (IL-6, TGFB, and GM-CSF). MDSCs will be phenotyped as lineage negative CD11b+CD14-MHCII-. Readouts will include flow cytometry, multiplex ELISA, and RNA sequencing from multiple time points, including pre-surgery, post-surgery, and post-immunotherapy. 

Aim 2:  Evaluate circulating NK and MDSC levels in relation to clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that patients with greater increases in MDSCs will show lower numbers and cytotoxicity of NK cells with shorter survival time. Readouts will include numbers/ function of NK cells stratified by peak and fold change in MDSC levels with correlation to survival time.","Osteosarcoma (OSA) in dogs is similar to that in humans, and our research team has found promising effects of inhaled IL-15 immunotherapy in dogs with gross metastatic disease. In this proposal, we aim to assess the link between surgery, MDSC expansion, and resistance to IL-15 immunotherapy in canine OSA.

We have made the following progress on our research. We have performed single cell RNA sequencing on 4 dogs to date, including 2 dogs with long disease-free interval (DFI) and 2 dogs with short DFI, using these dogs to represent favorable and unfavorable oncologic outcomes, respectively. We have analyzed immune cell populations in the blood at 4 time points. We have exciting data that MDSCs are upregulated after surgery and that patients with higher proportions of MDSCs have worse oncologic outcomes, i.e. they have shorter DFI. We have performed multiplex ELISA for serum cytokines associated with MDSC expansion (Aim 1) but have not observed statistically significant associations between changes in myelopoiesis cytokines and clinical outcomes. We are waiting additional sequencing data on MDSC populations to analyze the relationship between cytokines and changes in MDSC frequencies because flow cytometry analysis has proven challenging on cryopreserved specimens. 

We have experienced 2 major barriers. Flow cytometry has been inconsistent, as noted above. RNA sequencing has been very robust, but the workflow for RNA sequencing requires more time. Depending on how busy the UC Davis’ Genome Center core is, it can take 4 plus months to get data back plus additional time to analyze data. Ensuring appropriate handling of irreplaceable PBMC samples for single cell sequencing to ensure quality data are obtained is a major contributor to this extension request. 

Our major accomplishments to date include 2 abstracts presented at scientific meetings (Razmara et al, SITC, and Razmara et al. AAI) as well as 2 original research publications in preparation. 

We will spend the remainder of the grant period completing single cell sequencing analyses to analyze the link between surgery, MDSC expansion, and resistance to IL-15 immunotherapy in canine OSA, and we have applied for additional funding to dissect MDSC-mediated resistance to IL-15 immunotherapy in canine osteosarcoma via IL-15 receptor alpha- STAT3 signaling."

This is largely driven by a lack of effective treatment options. The majority of PDA patients receive conventional chemotherapy, and while some initially respond to the standard of care therapies, most do not maintain a durable response or rapidly develop chemoresistance. This project aims to overcome resistance to gemcitabine, one of the most widely used cytotoxic agents in PDA therapy. Improvement of gemcitabine chemotherapy combinations represents an immediately translatable clinical benefit to PDA patients.

To develop methods to overcome gemcitabine resistance, we have generated models of chemoresistance in syngeneic murine PDA lines and assembled a library of pancreatic cancer patient-derived organoids with an array of responses to gemcitabine. Through transcriptional profiling, we identified several mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming in our gemcitabine resistant models. Further characterization revealed several potential metabolic vulnerabilities, including the mevalonate pathway. We have generated preliminary data showing that approaches targeting the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, HMG-CoA reductase, are significantly more potent in gemcitabine resistant PDA cells than in the respective parental counterparts.  Downstream rescue experiments have demonstrated that the main impact is through loss of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate levels, however, further investigation will be needed to provide additional mechanistic details. 

The research in this proposal will determine the potential of combining gemcitabine treatment with inhibition of the mevalonate pathway to treat chemoresistant PDA. We will use both immune-competent murine allografts and patient-derived organoids as preclinical models. In addition, we will examine the impact of other identified metabolic targets that can potentially be used to overcome the acquisition of gemcitabine resistance. Finally, we will test if the approaches to overcome gemcitabine chemoresistance are also effective against PDA cells that are resistant to other clinically deployed therapies. These approaches have potential for rapid translation, and the data generated in this proposal can be used to inform clinical trial designs here at UCI.","1) Brief overview of the project
This project seeks to identify strategies to overcome resistance to chemotherapy by pancreatic cancer cells. To accomplish this, we generated pairs of chemotherapy resistant pancreatic cancer cells and use the chemotherapy sensitive parental lines as a point of comparison. As the standard of care chemotherapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the most common form of pancreatic cancer, relies on anti-metabolite chemotherapy, we focused our efforts on metabolic reprogramming. 

2) Progress toward the completion of stated research aims. 
During the duration of support for this project, we identified the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming of pancreatic cancer cells during the acquisition of chemoresistance. Here, we found that the way the cancer cells resistant treatment makes them less impacted by metabolites released by immune cells and fibroblasts the make up more than half of these tumors. We further demonstrated that this reprogramming left the cells sensitive to blockage of the specific pathway that is inhibited by the drug family known as statins.

3) Barriers that were overcome or not overcome
We identified that the conditions imposed using patient-derived organoids in 3D cultures act to enforce a phenotype that makes them intrinsically sensitive to statin treatment. Accordingly, this model was found to not be an appropriate avenue to this study. However, we were able to identify the molecular characteristics underpinning this observation, making this finding impactful.

4) Summary or list of the major accomplishments of the research
Pancreatic cancer cells downregulated nucleoside transporters and the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway during the acquisition of chemoresistance. 

Chemoresistance of this type is associated with downregulation of oncogenic signaling and presentation of an epithelial phenotype

Statin treatment can be used to kill chemoresistant pancreatic cancer cells.

5) plans for continuation of the research or project.

We are currently developing an investigator-initiated clinical trial to combine statins with chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. We are also following up the reprogramming of the pancreatic tumor microenvironment by chemoresistance pancreatic cancer cells by analysis of single-cell sequencing data and subsequent functional validation."

Radiation therapy combined with surgery is the standard-of-care for sarcoma treatment; however, radiation causes severe, permanent damage to the surrounding tissues including depletion of the skeletal muscle stem cells required for maintenance and repair. Because sarcomas disproportionally affect young people (11% of all adolescent cancers), patients that survive radiation will experience muscle atrophy and reduced mobility over their lifetime.  

We have a strategy to generate skeletal muscle from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with the ability to build new muscles following transplantation. Since hPSCs can be readily obtained from patients from any genetic background and expanded indefinitely, we have an opportunity to provide a robust cell therapy to reconstruct tissues for sarcoma survivors. We hypothesize that transplanted hPSC derived skeletal muscle will prevent muscle atrophy and loss of muscle function after surgery and irradiation in Rhabdomyosarcomas.

Aim 1. Generate a Rhabdomyosarcoma mouse model to evaluate the effects on muscle stem cell repair and function. We will perform allogenic transplant of bioluminescent-expressing human sarcoma cells into quadriceps of mice to induce tumor formation. Tumors will be subject to surgical removal and/or radiation therapy at multiple time points. We will evaluate endogenous muscle stem cell’s ability to regenerate functional muscle at treated tumor sites.

Aim 2. Test transplantation of hPSC skeletal muscle to restore the stem cell pool and muscle function. It’s unclear whether the volumetric muscle loss following surgical tumor removal or irradiated tissue remnants, such as extracellular matrices, can support engraftment of muscle stem cells. We will perform cell transplantations at irradiated sites with or without hydrogel plugs to test cell replacement of functional skeletal muscles within the irradiated muscle environment.

If successful, our immediate goal would be to leverage pilot funding toward the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) DISC2 Quest grant, which would enable us to pursue an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for moving forward with translating muscle stem cell therapies for cancer survivors.",

Maternal obesity and high birth weight are repeatedly associated with various cancers in children and adults. The IGF axis has been highlighted as a plausible underlying mechanism given that i) IGF-1 and IGF-2 are present in fetal circulation and play key roles in fetal growth and development; ii) IGF-1 is strongly positively correlated with fetal growth and birth weight; and iii) the IGF axis is implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of different types of human cancer such as colon, breast, prostate, lung and leukemia. Early-life efforts for cancer prevention may therefore begin in utero through modulation of the fetal IGF axis, which is thought to be stimulated by circulating glucose and insulin. Maternal diet may be a key modifiable factor via its influence on glucose tolerance.

We propose a prospective observational study of N=80 pregnant women with pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity and diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, leveraging the high proportion of Hispanic and Asian women who obtain prenatal care at the UCI medical center. Maternal diet in each trimester will be assessed using two 24-hour dietary recalls and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index for Pregnancy will be computed as a measure of diet quality. At 28 weeks’ gestation, maternal fasting glucose, insulin, and c-peptide will be measured and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance computed. Maternal glucose concentrations from the standard glucose challenge test will be abstracted from medical record. Neonatal IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 will be assayed from cord blood. The separate and combined contribution of maternal diet and glucose-insulin homeostasis to variation in concentrations of cord blood IGFs and IGFBPs will be analyzed, with trimester-specific analysis for the effects of maternal diet. Analyses will be adjusted for maternal demographics, gestational weight gain, infant sex, and gestational age at birth. 

It is expected that this study will generate novel preliminary data to test if modifiable gestational exposures may influence offspring IGF axis, representing a possible early-life window for cancer prevention efforts.","1) This project aims to understand how maternal diet and blood sugar control during pregnancy is associated with markers of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis of the newborn, measured from cord blood. The project involves enrolling pregnant patients attending UCI Health for prenatal care, assessing demographics and health status through online surveys, assessing dietary intakes 3 times across pregnancy, and collecting a maternal fasting blood sample at 26-28 weeks' gestation to measure glucose, insulin and c-peptide. When a participant delivers, the goal is to collect a sample of cord blood to be analyzed for IGF biomarkers. A total of n=67 pregnant participants with collection of all data including cord blood at delivery is required to address the research question.
2) Over the past year, we have successfully enrolled 29 pregnant participants and of those, 4 dropped from the study without completing data collection. Among active participants, data collection during pregnancy has been completed on 15; other participants are still earlier in their pregnancy and data collection is ongoing. 11 active participants to date have delivered and of those, cord blood samples were collected and tested for the required biomarkers on 6 participants.
3) The main barrier encountered to date is missing cord blood sample collection at delivery. The PI has been liaising with labor and delivery nurses and OBGYN physicians to try find the best workflow to make sure future samples are not missed. This issue requires ongoing communication to break down the barrier. Enrollment progress was also slow in the beginning as we did not have access to all prenatal clinics for in-person recruitment. We now have approval to recruit in person at two major clinic sites and we receive referrals from some OBGYN providers for potentially eligible patients.
4) Major accomplishments of the research include: established an automated, secure workflow to identify eligible pregnant patients from the medical record; recruited almost half of our required participant number; good retention rate of enrolled participants; built relationship with L&D nurses to improve cord blood collection workflow.
5) Plans for continuation of the research include ongoing recruitment and enrollment to reach 67 with complete data, abstracting birth outcome data from the medical record, and performing data analysis."

The standard of care for patients who relapse or have refractory (R/R) DLBCL >12 months after initial treatment is an autologous, or in some instances, an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). For patients who relapse <12 months after first-line therapy, HCT is still an option, with the addition of chimeric antigen T-cell therapy more recently becoming a standard of care treatment in this setting. Patients often receive second and further lines of chemo-immunotherapy for disease control for R/R DLBCL, but without HCT, all therapies are palliative in nature. 

The utilization of HCT in patients with DLBCL remains low for certain patients and can be impacted by multiple factors, such as access to a transplant center and insurance status. Prior studies have found racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of autologous HCT in lymphoma patients, with Non-Hispanic Black patients undergoing HCT less often than their Non-Hispanic White counterparts and having inferior survival. To date, little is known about the influence of sociodemographic and clinical factors on HCT utilization for patients with lymphoma over time. 

In order to identify barriers to care in patients with DLBCL, we propose a retrospective cohort study of all DLBCL patients diagnosed in California from 1992 to 2016 using a novel data linkage from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), California Cancer Registry (CCR), and statewide hospitalization data. A study in multiple myeloma patients from this linkage has identified that each of the three data sources independently capture HCT utilization, permitting the assessment of utilization of HCT at the population-level. These data sources also include sociodemographic factors (race/ethnicity, health insurance status, neighborhood socioeconomic status, sex, and age at diagnosis) and clinical factors (e.g., chemo-immunotherapy, disease stage, and comorbidities). This study will identify changes in sociodemographic and clinical associations with HCT over time and inform strategies to help to improve HCT rates, which is a curative therapy for patients with R/R DLBCL.",

This rewiring enhances cancer growth but can also generate vulnerabilities to therapeutic interventions. To enable cell proliferation, cancers frequently deregulate key transitions in the tightly-controlled cell division cycle. Prior work has focused on developing therapeutic agents that target uncontrolled entry into the DNA replication phase of the cell cycle in cancers (the G1-S transition). In this proposal, we will develop an unexpected observation that implicates BET (Bromodomain and ExtraTerminal domain) proteins in promoting entry into mitosis after completion of DNA replication (the G2-to-M transition). BET proteins harbor two domains that recognize acetylated lysine residues and are emerging targets for cancer therapy based on their involvement in numerous chromatin-related functions, including transcriptional regulation and protection from DNA damage. Employing a live imaging assay for quantitatively monitoring mitotic entry in single cells, we have observed a role for BET proteins in promoting the G2-to-M transition. BET inhibition delays mitotic entry in cancer-derived and non-transformed, immortalized cell lines. In a specific colorectal cancer-derived cell line, BET inhibition strongly synergizes with inhibition of the mitotic kinase PLK1 to block mitotic entry. The proposed work will investigate how BET proteins contribute to mitotic entry, testing specific hypotheses related to transcriptional regulation, DNA damage, and the mitotic entry circuit. The proposed effort represents an entirely new research area for the group, which has historically focused on chromosome segregation, centrosome function, spindle assembly, and checkpoint function during mitosis. Successful execution of the project has the potential to advance understanding of the cellular functions of BET proteins and of the control of mitotic entry in human cells, while also revealing whether there are opportunities for targeting the G2-M transition of the cell cycle, as has been done for the G1-S transition, in specific cancer contexts.","The goal of this project was to explore a potential new role for a set of chromatin-binding proteins called Bromodomain and Extra Terminal domain protein (BETs) in controlling the transition of cells from an interphase to mitotic state. BET proteins are major drug targets for cancer therapy and elucidating their biological functions is important from both fundamental and therapeutic perspectives. The first goal was to address how BET proteins acted in promoting the transition to mitosis, analyzing potential roles in transcription and DNA damage repair, while also employing small molecule inhibitors to assess the time when BET protein action was needed. The second goal was to define the specific BET protein, from the four that are present in humans, that is important for the interphase-to-mitosis transition. We successfully achieved both of the major goals during the support period and are well-poised to extend the work to generate an impactful publication and submit a grant application in the upcoming year. In brief, transcriptomic and DNA damage analysis did not suggest an obvious mechanism for why BET proteins are important for the transition to mitosis. We thus expended significant effort on the inhibitor addition experiments coupled with live imaging, which revealed that BET inhibitors need to be added ~100 min prior to the transition to mitosis in order to have an effect. These data suggested that a labile BET-dependent product is important for the transition to mitosis. We are currently pursuing additional transcriptomic analysis and planning proteomics with synchronized cells to define this potential labile product. For the second goal, we generated inducible knockout cell lines and found that BRD4 is the likely BET protein important for the transition into mitosis. We are currently building a BRD4 replacement system to test specific engineered mutants that perturb its roles in transcriptional elongation and chromatin binding via recognition of acetylated histone tails. The work conducted has been presented at local symposia and at international cell biology meetings and has been met with significant interest."

In our recent theoretical study, we proposed that the Warburg Effect stems from the optimization of energy metabolism that allows cells to produce ATP at the highest rate in the presence of excess glucose independent of cell growth rate. By estimating the yield, specific activity, and proteome occupancy of the glycolysis and respiration pathways from published studies in bacteria, yeast, and mammals, we found that for each organism, the data is consistent with glycolysis producing ATP at a faster rate per gram of pathway protein than respiration. However, we could only find a limited number of published datasets for mammalian cells that contain measurements required for our calculations. Here, we propose to perform rigorous measurements of glycolysis and respiration pathway rates per gram of pathway protein in mammalian cancer cell lines to generate additional evidence to support or refute our hypothesis. Our lab has extensive experience performing metabolic flux and proteomics measurements in mammalian cells that will be required for this project, which will allow us to complete the proposed measurement within the 1-year duration of the Seed Grant. Taken together, our study will rigorously test the hypothesis that the Warburg Effect is an expected consequence of the optimization of cancer cell energy metabolism toward maximal energy production rates and might lead to the development of novel anticancer treatments specifically targeting the vulnerabilities of cancer cell bioenergetics.","Project Overview: Our research aims to understand how adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production influences cell proliferation. Specifically, we determined whether the rate of ATP production from glycolysis, a process that breaks down glucose, rather than respiration, is essential for rapid cell division.
Progress and Discoveries: Our study has demonstrated that ATP production rates increase in proportion to cell growth rates across various organisms, including bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells. We found a strong correlation in mammals that reaffirms the role of ATP in supporting rapid cell proliferation. Our results suggest that for fast-growing cells, glycolysis is more critical than respiration in meeting the high energy demands. Furthermore, we established that ATP production rates are limiting for cell growth when challenged with additional ATP demand.
Challenges and Solutions: We encountered challenges in quantifying ATP limits in mammalian cells, which previously has been less understood that are easier to control growth rates in chemostats such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae. By combining measurements of cell growth, lactate production, and oxygen consumption, we have determined the ATP production directly from cell cultures. We have also used a combination of small molecules and genetically encoded tool for the manipulation of metabolism (GEMM) to probe the limitation of ATP production rate to support rapid growth and the needed contribution from glycolysis and respiration. 
Major Accomplishments:
1.	Established a linear relationship between ATP production and growth rates in multiple mammalian cell types.
2.	Demonstrated that glycolysis, not respiration, is vital for meeting the energy needs of rapidly proliferating cells.
3.	Utilized a novel genetic tool, ATPGobble, to manipulate ATP levels in cells, to determine the limitation of ATP production on growth.
Future Directions: We plan to further explore how manipulating ATP production affects cell growth. We will expand our studies to include more cell lines and test the impact of increasing or decreasing ATP production through various genetic and chemical means. Our goal is to deepen our understanding of cellular energy metabolism and its role in diseases like cancer, where cell proliferation is often uncontrolled."

Metastasis accounts for the majority of cancer related deaths and therapeutic strategies that can prevent or reduce metastatic burden are urgently needed. The lung is the most common site of metastasis in several cancers such as breast, lung, colon, melanoma, bladder, prostate and kidney. Recent studies have shown that cancer cells guide the creation of a pre-metastatic niche to exit cellular dormancy and proliferate to form metastatic lesions. Cancer cells achieve this by secretion of specific cytokines that promote an immune suppressive phenotype in the secondary organ. However, the role of the secondary organ in creating the metastatic niche is underappreciated. Moreover, it is unclear if and how previous injury through respiratory infections and pulmonary fibrosis can influence the growth of metastatic cancer cells in the lung. Among individuals hospitalized for severe respiratory viral infections, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, 25 - 50% of patients experience persistent respiratory symptoms due to chronic effects of lung tissue damage. Our research has demonstrated that these infections induce distinct fibroblast activation states that drive immunopathology during acute infection and promote pulmonary fibrosis following clearance of the infection. We have also developed a clinically relevant and well characterized influenza model in mice that allows us to study persistent inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis at chronic, post-viral stages of disease. Working in collaboration with the Sikandar lab at UC Santa Cruz, we have optimized this model to study breast cancer metastasis following viral infection. We are uniquely positioned to ask the following questions: 1. Does prior respiratory viral infection promote metastasis of breast tumor cells to the lung tissue? 2. Do inflammatory lung fibroblasts activated following severe viral infection promote metastatic niches for tumor cells? Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays we will test our working hypothesis that damage to the lung by viral infection resulting in persistent inflammation and fibrosis creates a metastatic niche promoting proliferation of breast tumor cells.","The lungs are the most common site of metastasis for many cancers, in particular breast cancer. While a large number of studies have focused on understanding and targeting metastatic tumor cells, it is important to understand what factors in the lung tissue contribute to the formation of overt metastasis. Recent studies, including our own, have demonstrated that severe, acute lung injury following respiratory viral infection results in inflammation and tissue damage that does not heal properly. The lung tissue environments following severe respiratory viral infection are strikingly similar to environments that have been shown to promote metastasis. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that severe respiratory viral infections and the resulting chronic inflammation and tissue damage promote overt metastasis of breast cancer cells to the lungs. Over the course of the project period, we made progress in addressing each of the stated aims in the proposal. For Aim 1, we established a mouse model of breast cancer cell metastasis following severe influenza virus infection. Using this mouse model, we made the exciting discovery that a severe influenza virus infection does promote overt metastasis of breast cancer cells from the primary tumor to the lungs. Additional experiments implicated inflammatory lung fibroblasts, activated following influenza virus infection, in promoting metastatic outgrowth of breast cancer cells in the lung tissue. This project supported by the UCOP CRCC has pushed our work on influenza immunology and fibroblast biology into exciting new directions and is independent of other ongoing work in our laboratory supported by the NIH. Following the end of the project period, we will continue this work by further exploring the mechanisms by which a prior severe respiratory infection alters the lung environment to predispose the tissue to metastatic outgrowth. In the immediate future, we plan to perform single-cell gene expression and spatial transcriptomics studies to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the activated cell types in this model and the cell-cell interactions that promote metastasis of breast cancer cells in the lungs. Results from this project will provide strong preliminary data to apply for additional external funding."

Although classically druggable, no commercially available inhibitors of Gαs exist. Here, we propose an innovative approach to develop and characterize chemical inhibitors of Gαs. Given prior in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating that GNAS knockout is lethal to GNASR201 tumors, there is a high likelihood that chemical inhibition of Gαs will be an effective therapeutic strategy for GNASR201 mutant tumors. 

New Treatments are Needed for Appendiceal Cancer, Currently an Orphan Disease. 

Appendiceal tumors encompass a rare and diverse group of neoplasms; AA is the most common histologic subtype. Epidemiologic studies based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data have shown a steady increase in incidence from approximately 0.2 cases per 100,000 in the 1970s, to current estimates of just over 1 per 100,000. In comparison, this is 40-fold less common than colon cancer, which in the US has an incidence of approximately 40 per 100,000. Cases of early-onset AA, defined as diagnosis before age 50, have increased by 24% between 2011 to 2016, and in 2016 represented 40% of all appendiceal cancer. In contrast, the increase in early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) was only 2.2% for that same time period. Historically, appendiceal tumors have been grouped together with CRCs, and as of 2021 the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines still suggested that appendiceal tumors be treated with chemotherapy similarly to colon tumors. The rarity of AA has made it difficult to conduct clinical trials, and in the absence of trial data, the NCCN guidelines assume biological similarity due to anatomic vicinity, common embryological origin, and common expression of the transcription factor CDX2. However, there is a growing consensus that AA is a clinically and molecularly distinct entity from CRC, and that AA specific therapies (none exist currently) need to be developed. We have discovered two druggable sites on GNAS and have developed small molecule inhibitors targeting the site next to the point of mutation.","This project has been focused on developing new drugs for cancers which currently lack therapeutic options. In this study research is performed by chemists with the world leading clinician studying and treating appendix cancer, a form of cancer that does not have a directed treatment option and is only treated in analogy to other forms of cancer, an undesirable approach. Appendix cancer is listed as an orphan disease as a result. Clinical evaluation of patient samples has revealed that appendix cancer frequently has a mutation the Gα protein GNAS, which encodes for the heterotrimeric G protein Gαs. This is important as this is the second most frequently mutated gene in mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma (AA) (~50% of tumors) and Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (PMP, ~75% of tumors) and third most common in non-mucinous AA (~25% of tumors). In addition, many other difficult cancers to treat have been found to have this and related mutation in GNAS. Over the period of this grant, we have worked to develop inhibitors of this mutant by targeting a binding site in proximity to the most frequent mutation site. Based on a lead compound, guanosine epoxide, we created we have tried to improve the potency and activity of the inhibitors synthesize. Challenges arose in that the complex hypothetical inhibitors were recalcitrant to modern synthetic methods and several approaches failed to access the final compound that could be evaluated in cells or animal models. While this did limit the assessment to compounds the chemistry platform that has been developed and our new understanding of what can, and cannot, be achieved provides a clear path forward. Using the lessons gained under this proposal we will be able to assemble the new inhibitors in the next year with appropriate support. These molecules represent the missing piece in these drug development studies as the in vitro and in vivo assays have been developed with our collaborators at MD Anderson and they are ready to be used to assess our tailor made inhibitors in the future."

Drugs that target the innate immune protein STING elicit potent anti-cancer responses in mice, and >15 STING agonists entered clinical trials in the past 10 years. However, in 2023 the first trial results showed a lack of efficacy. The emerging challenges in the field are now to increase efficacy of innate immune agonists while maintaining tumor-specific T cell responses. 
We recently discovered that STING agonist efficacy is dramatically enhanced when used in combination with agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), another class of innate immune receptors. We found that a single combination dose can elicit complete responses in >80% of mice bearing established B16-F10 melanomas, as compared to 25% with monotherapy. Mice that cleared primary tumors developed resistance to tumor cell rechallenge. This demonstrates that the challenges of efficacy and T cell priming can be overcome through STING+TLR agonist combination therapy. 
However, key questions regarding the mechanisms of synergy are unanswered, including: what cytokines and cell types are required for the anti-tumor synergy elicited by STING+TLR agonists? Understanding this mechanism will aid future clinical studies on innate immune agonist therapies for cancer.
We propose in Aim 1 to determine the role for immune cells in the anti-tumor response to combination therapy. We will use flow cytometry to measure T cell activation and the abundance of immune cell types including neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. To determine the requirement for these cells in the anti-tumor synergy, we will deplete CD8, CD4, and NK cells and measure tumor volume after therapy. This will determine the cellular mechanisms of anti-tumor synergy. Then in Aim 2, we will identify the cytokines required for eliciting synergistic anti-tumor responses to STING+TLR combination therapy in vivo. IL-12 and TNF-a are upregulated in response to STING+TLR agonist co-administration, but their necessity is unknown. We will neutralize these cytokines and measure tumor volume after therapy. Together, this work will determine the cytokines and cell types required for STING+TLR agonist synergy, advancing the field and paving the way for clinical trials with combinations of innate immune agonists.",

The c-Myc oncogene encodes a transcription factor and thus regulates many other genes. However, transcription factors are difficult targets for which to design drugs.

As exemplified by c-Myc, genetic interactions are at the root of normal and malignant cell growth. Interactions between gene pairs have been cataloged in mammalian cells by combining knockouts created using CRISPR/Cas9 or siRNA and observing the changes in cell growth. However, these piecemeal approaches are laborious and expensive and do not address the  >200 million genetic interactions that potentially occur. 

An approach that can affordably map the entire array of genetic interactions in normal and diseased cells is urgently needed. We have developed a technology using radiation hybrid (RH) cells that is capable of elucidating with high sensitivity and specificity genes that interact even though they are located at a distance within in the genome. Our approach yields high-resolution, comprehensive maps of interacting gene pairs. 

RH panels are constructed by lethally irradiating cells so that the DNA shatters. The fragments are then introduced into living cells so that a random assortment, ~25%, of genes are triploid rather than diploid. Statistically significant patterns of co-inherited triploid genes point to the cell's survival mechanism. Most importantly, the fragments are so small that the technique often provides single-gene resolution, revealing with specificity the multiple roles one gene plays within a cell. Our preliminary data shows that low pass genome sequencing of nascent human RH clones (RH-Seq) is an economical approach to constructing interaction maps. The network showed significant overlap with a previous network obtained by us that established the groundwork for the RH approach and showed that coinheritance of distant genes is an important mechanism for cell viability. 

Our goal is to map genetic interactions for the entire genome in normal cells and cells that overexpress c-Myc. The result will be a high resolution map of the genetic interactions that drive cell growth in the context of aberrant c-Myc expression, providing new, highly relevant targets for treatment.",

Therefore, the basal activation level of the immune system may determine the rate of successful metastases in individual patients and could be a viable therapeutic target to slow cancer progression. Our recent work has suggested that the gut microbiota is a potent source for immune stimulatory molecules and that an individual’s microbiota can correlate with their responsiveness to cancer immunotherapies. Thus, we hypothesize that the microbiota’s capacity to generate specific, immune active metabolites may more broadly affect cancer progression including the successful formation of new metastatic sites. 
	This one-year, pilot project will focus on two aims. First, we will examine whether increasing the processing of bacterial cell wall in the gut can control the metastatic progression of melanoma. This will be accomplished using our previous model to orally supplement the gut microbiota with specific microbes or enzymes and will be applied to the established murine model of melanoma metastasis using intravenous injection of B16-F10 cells. Second, we will define host factors caused by increased enzymatic activity in the gut that may function as both biomarkers and causal agents for immune activity against circulating and newly colonizing tumor cells. Here, we will use targeted mass spectrometry to quantify muramic acid in murine blood samples after supplementation as a proxy readout for circulating cell wall fragments. We will also use flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify and characterize a population of bacterial cell wall-responsive CX3CR1+Ly6Clo patrolling monocytes as a cellular biomarker and a potential effector cell population for reduced metastasis. 
	These studies align with our laboratory’s broader goals (1) to define the mechanisms of immune activation by the gut microbiota during cancer progression and treatment and (2) to develop enzyme- and probiotic-based methods to selectively augment host immune responses as single agents or in combination with other cancer therapies. If successful, this work will provide direct evidence that modulation of enzymatic capacity in the gut – that is, the overall ability to selectively produce metabolites – can alter immune-mediated protection against metastasis.",

Yet, these alone are insufficient to predict an individual’s disease onset and risks, indicating that nongenetic events within the tumor ecosystem (‘niches’) play a role in unleashing tumorigenesis. Stem cells are the origin of many life-threatening malignancies and are notorious for their tight dependency on the surrounding microenvironment. Despite undisputed importance, our understanding of how the ecosystems that stem cells inhabit direct oncogenic fate flexibility is limited. Equally, it remains a mystery whether early-stage tumor initiation through advanced disease progression is supported by overlapping or distinct niches. These gaps in knowledge can largely be attributed to a dearth of tools and models that capture the oncogenic stem cell identity landscape in intact tissues. 

The lymphatic vascular network is an emerging, previously unrecognized niche entity for epithelial stem cells, yet much of the mystery of the lymphatic niches in directing tumorigenesis remains untapped. The goal of our proposed work is to determine how distinct vascular cues drive oncogenic flexibility and tumorigenesis in rare pre-cancer stem cells. Using deep imaging and sequencing approaches in skin squamous cell carcinoma, we discovered that lymphatic vascular insufficiency predisposes to malignant transformation. Detailed temporal volumetric imaging revealed that oncogenic plasticity propelling the transition from benign to metastatic carcinoma is preceded by dynamic lymphatic remodeling. These results raise the intriguing possibility that lymphatic niches evolve during disease progression, directing oncogenic tolerance in tumor-initiating cells while becoming a significant barrier to cancer treatments. To fill these knowledge gaps, we aim to determine how vascular circuits shape oncogenic tolerance in mutated yet untransformed cells in concert with their evolving niches, and to identify non-mutational drivers that build the pro-metastatic niche using our newly developed enhancer-based proximity sensor technology. Our innovative approach will define how vascular circuits shape the stem cell oncogenic landscape. A successful outcome of these studies holds promise for the development of therapeutics that block early cancer progression and pave the way to combat advanced metastatic disease.",

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a powerful strategy for cancer treatment that offers new opportunities for patients with malignant gliomas. However, there are several barriers that possibly dampen the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy for glioma, including the intrinsic nonimmunogenic phenotype of glioma cells and their immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To solve this problem, we have established murine orthotopic GBM models for optimizing IL13Rα2 CAR-T cell therapeutic parameters for clinical translation through collaboration. The immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models of GBM, and murine-CAR-T cells more precisely recapitulate patient glioma tumors and will provide essential information regarding the effect of therapies on the TME. For effective CAR-T therapy against GBM, it has been shown that activation of endogenous T cells and  anti-tumor TME is required. 

Protein Phosphatase 2A is heterotrimeric, consisting of scaffolding (A), regulatory (B), and catalytic (C) subunits that interact to form a functional holoenzyme.  We were the first to demonstrate that inhibiting PP2A enhanced immunogenicity of glioma cells to induce sensitivity to tumor specific T cells mediated killing and reprogrammed the TME toward anti tumor.  We demonstrated that LB-100, small molecule inhibitor of the conserved catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac), synergizes with PD1 blockade in multiple in vivo tumor models including GBM7,8. These results led to a phase I/II clinical trial testing LB100 in patients with recurrent GBM (NCT03027388) and a combination trial with anti-PD-1 in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (NCT06065462). Elucidating the role of PP2Ac within different cell types of the TME in regulating tumor sensitivity to CAR-T therapy is critical to inform rational combination in future clinical trials. 

We hypothesize that inhibition of PP2Ac will overcome the barriers for CAR-T cell therapy in glioma TME, and combination of IL13Rα2 CAR-T cell therapy and PP2A inhibitor will be a potential novel combination treatment for brain tumors. Successful completion of this project will provide preclinical insights to initiate novel clinical trials of combining PP2A inhibitor with IL13Rα2 CAR-T therapy.",

Unfortunately, patients who develop metastatic BC (mBC) have a poor 5-year survival of ~15%. Recently, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting the surface protein NECTIN4 (enfortumab vedotin, EV) was approved, validating NECTIN4 as an important target in mBC. Although EV monotherapy has a response rate of 44%, resistance invariably develops to the ADC. Interestingly, our preliminary and unpublished data demonstrates that NECTIN4 expression is retained on the surface of EV-resistant cells (that we generated in the lab) as well as in patient biopsy samples post-EV resistance (measured by immunohistochemistry). Therefore, we hypothesize that additional strategies to target NECTIN4 using CAR T and radioimmunotherapies (RIT) are rapidly needed, and will be efficacious both in EV-naïve and EV-resistant settings. However, to date, neither of these therapeutic modalities have been approved for bladder cancer patients. In this proposal, we will develop these two approaches and perform rigorous preclinical evaluation using 3 in vivo model systems: 1) an orthotopic bladder tumor model; 2) a subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model; and 3) a lung metastasis model. Our study will also use unique PDX’s developed at UCSF from minority patients (an important understudied population) and models of EV resistance that we created in our lab. If our results are positive, we plan to translate our findings into an investigator-initiated clinical trial, and will have two non-overlapping opportunities to do so – one with the CAR T and the other with the RIT. As a translational genitourinary medical oncologist and lab-based investigator, I have extensive experience leading pre-clinical studies of novel agents in the lab and running investigated-initiated clinical trials at UCSF. I am also fortunate to work with a fantastic team, so that we can translate findings from the bench to the bedside and back again. Overall, this application represents an important step in developing novel NECTIN4-targeting strategies, with implications that may extend beyond bladder cancer to other NECTIN4-positive tumor types such as breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancers.",

The preliminary discovery was serendipitous but the PI is trying to acquire funding to pursue this important finding. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising targeted treatment for cancer. However, current PDT is limited by low tissue penetration, insufficient phototoxicity (toxicity with light irradiation), and undesirable cytotoxicity (toxicity without light irradiation). Recently, Sophia and Richard Lunt introduced a novel platform for tuning the toxicity of near-infrared (NIR) light activated photosensitizers (PSs) through counterion pairing in organic salts, achieving greater tissue penetration, improved phototoxicity, and minimal cytotoxicity. It turns out that using this approach, but with special molecules called carborane anions developed in Lavallo's lab, unprecedented higher potency and efficacy against primary breast tumors as well as metastatic breast cancer cells has been observed. Sophia Lunt has characterized their cellular
uptake, organelle localization, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suppression of pro-metastatic pathways, and activation of apoptotic pathways using metastatic breast cancer cell lines. Further she has shown that Lavallo's molecules have the ability to create PSs that stop tumor growth in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer to an unprecedented level. The newly developed lead PS formulation introduces a potent therapeutic approach against aggressive breast cancer cells while decreasing side effects in healthy cells. This seed grant funding will be used by Lavallo's group to create libraries of commercially unavailable carborane salts and provide them to the Lunt groups for elaboration and exploration of structure activity/toxicity relationships of the therapeutics.

Pathogenesis is driven by high rates of viral hepatitis, untreated cirrhosis, and limited access to HCC screening and treatment. Globally, 2.5% of patients with cirrhosis will develop HCC each year. With adequate resources around 40% of diagnosed HCC patients will receive curative surgical resection, local ablation, or transplant, however in SSA less than 1% of patients receive such treatment. In Tanzania, there is a national effort to improve early diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Despite this, the multidisciplinary liver tumor board (MDTB) at the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) notes that treatment rates for localized HCC are less than 25% of expected. Access to treatment and resources are limited outside of the largest hospitals and care recommendations vary by location, resulting in delayed, disjointed, and uncoordinated care. 
The landscape for HCC care in Tanzania is unknown. We hypothesize that lack of established referral pathways and treatment guidelines contribute to deficient treatment rates. To address the current absence of HCC data and facilitate treatment, we aim to perform the following: 1) Perform a national assessment of HCC diagnostic and treatment resources, including screening infrastructure, surgical and locoregional capacity, systemic treatment availability, and access to supportive care, 2) Implement a national virtual liver cancer tumor board to strengthen multidisciplinary care and coordination, and 3) Develop contextualized and resource-specific treatment guidelines for liver cancer in Tanzania with assessment of impact using a retrospective patient cohort. 
Nation liver cancer care capacity assessments will be performed at all major public medical centers to identify available physical and human resources. The virtual tumor board will be distributed nationwide for optimal provider engagement, with implementation success measured by participation and effect on care recommendations. Resource-specific treatment guidelines for liver cancer in Tanzania will be developed on expert consensus. This proposal is part of a larger effort to improve cancer care in SSA and will provide valuable baseline data leading to future capacity building and intervention-driven research.",

While T cell therapies have brought about a transformative impact on cancer treatment, their effectiveness is limited to a few cancer types, and has struggled to be applicable to individuals with diverse immunogenetic profiles. There is an urgent need to shift our focus towards automated target discovery, with the aim of reaching a broader patient population. 

The overall goal of this project is to propel the discovery of targets for novel T-cell therapies and expand their use in patients with diverse immunogenetic backgrounds by deploying AI-driven tools to analyze high throughput RNA sequencing data.  My lab has recently developed an AI-driven framework and two pivotal datasets, containing 2 million publicly available single T cell transcriptomes, with matching T cell receptor data, and experimentally validated T cell antigen specificity data, extracted from 265 cancer patients, across 30 cancer types. This framework aims to accelerate the discovery of novel T cell therapies for cancer, promising faster and more cost effective development, with broader accessibility to diverse patient populations. Notably, ours is the only known methodology capable of automating the design of T cell therapies using data from an individual's adaptive immune system, without knowledge of their cancer genome.  

We harnessed our AI-driven framework and database to discover a novel T cell therapy that can target two key cancer antigens: insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2), prevalent in multiple cancer types, and associated with poorer patient survival, and well known target, melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells 1, (MART1). In collaboration with Dr. Powell at the UPenn, we are testing this newly discovered immunotherapy for clinical translation. We propose to leverage our framework for the discovery of: 1) multispecific T cell therapies simultaneously targeting multiple cancer antigen(s)  and 2) T cell therapies applicable to populations with diverse immunogenetic backgrounds. The CRCC funding will allow us to discover and gather preliminary data on additional targets that will be leveraged to obtain NIH funding.",

This process of malignant transformation endows some cells with extraordinary properties to avoid surveillance mechanisms, skip cell death, and proliferate indefinitely. Most cases of cellular transformation occur as tissues replace old and damaged cells with new ones. However, tissue renewal is challenging to analyze as it tends to happen simultaneously in many tissues that turnover at different rates for many years. In humans, for example, cellular turnover is continuous throughout the lifespan, deploying billions of cells daily to renew tissues such as blood, epidermis, and gastrointestinal epithelia. A significant limitation in the field is the lack of experimental models to analyze systemic tissue renewal and malignant transformation simultaneously. A predominant view explaining the progression of malignancy claims that the deregulation of tumor suppressors induces DNA damage that is present at the early stages in almost all cancers. 

We propose a paradigm shift by introducing a simplified experimental model to enable in situ analyses of cellular transformation during tissue renewal. The planarian flatworm continuously renews about 40 tissue types throughout the body, and we developed the first planarian cancer model by inhibiting PTEN, the second most inactivated gene in human cancers. PTEN-mediated cancer in planarians aggressively elicits a phenotype that resembles mammalian carcinogenesis. It takes less than two weeks to observe neoblast over-proliferation, tissue invasion, and the formation of lethal tumors. However, how malignancy arises and evolves during tissue renewal in planarians is unknown. We aim to leverage the integration of systemic tissue turnover and PTEN function to address the earliest manifestations of malignancy and identify the cells driving the cancer phenotype. Preliminary results demonstrate that DNA damage underlies cellular transformation that is detectable after a few hours of PTEN inhibition. The results also suggest that disrupting neural transcription factors essential for neurogenesis can prevent malignancy. We propose to analyze mechanisms of cellular transformation and the evolution of the cancer phenotype in planarians.",

Recent evidence has suggested that the growth and treatment refractoriness of GBM derives in large part from the dynamic interplay between tumor cells and supportive cells in the tumor microenvironment. Along those lines, my lab has intriguing data using single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify cells in GBM that express canonical cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) markers, have CAF morphology, and transcriptomically resemble CAFs from other cancers rather than other stromal cells with similar surface markers such as pericytes. These findings challenge conventional thinking because, while the existence of CAFs in many systemic cancers and their pro-tumoral effects were demonstrated over two decades ago, CAFs had been assumed to be absent in GBM given the lack of normal fibroblasts in the healthy brain. Using spatial transcriptomics, we also demonstrated that these CAFs are enriched in the perivascular niche (PVN) of GBM close to GBM stem cells (GSCs), where they increase GSC proliferation. GBM CAFs also promote pro-tumoral effects on macrophages in GBM. Here, we will build on this intriguing data by investigating our central hypothesis that the GBM PVN is a unique regional microenvironment in which GSCs recruit circulating marrow-derived progenitors that differentiate into CAFs that alter GSCs and their microenvironment in a pro-tumoral manner that promotes therapeutic resistance. We will investigate this hypothesis through three aims: Aim 1 – Determine the origin of CAFs in GBM and the mechanism of their recruitment to the GBM perivascular niche; Aim 2 - Define the immunosuppressive effects of CAFs on T-cells in the GBM microenvironment and the mechanisms of these effects; and Aim 3 - Characterize the role of CAFs in GBM resistance to standard cytotoxic therapies. We will use transcriptome-based lineage trajectory prediction algorithms and murine transplantation models to define the lineage of GBM CAFs, functional immune cell assays to assess the impact of GBM CAFs on immune cells in the microenvironment, and mouse models to delineate the impact of CAFs on GBM therapeutic resistance. Our work will challenge conventional thinking by showing that CAFs exist in GBM, where they are not merely bystanders but active participants in the growth and treatment refractoriness of the tumor.",

This proposed research is the first to consider how MMC influences progression in pancreatic ducal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC patients have a 5-year survival rate below 5%. While the PDAC is primarily driven by genetic mutations in KRAS and tumor suppressor genes, PDAC metastasis lacks recurrent genetic drivers. This suggests that non-genetic factors play a critical role in shaping the disease’s progression. Research shows a relationship between MMC and progress in other cancers. We propose investigating how nucleoplasmic MMC influences PDAC progression and metastasis using innovative tools like nucleoplasmic genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles and 3D PDAC organoid models. Our observations hint at perturbed nucleoplasmic MMC in metastatic PDAC organoids, suggesting a potential role in PDAC metastasis. Furthermore, analysis of existing PDAC organoid RNA-seq datasets has unveiled the up-regulation of nesprin-3, a crucial component of the outer nuclear membrane and the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, in metastatic PDAC organoids. LINC complexes govern cytoplasmic MMC, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, mechanotransduction, and chromatin organization. Our proposed experiments will determine whether nesprin-3 regulates nucleoplasmic MMC, offering a promising avenue for targeted therapy against PDAC metastasis. We will address two specific aims: 1) Do changes in nucleoplasmic MMC correlate with PDAC prognosis in 3D pancreatic organoid models? and 2) Do alterations in nucleoplasmic MMC affect PDAC cell metastatic capabilities in vivo? This proposal capitalizes on the synergy of an interdisciplinary collaboration between a developmental cell biologist (Daniel A. Starr), a quantitative cellular biophysicist (G.W. Gant Luxton), and an expert in PDAC and organoid modeling (Chang-Il Hwang). By bridging the gap between genetic and non-genetic factors, our study will provide comprehensive insights into the biophysical properties of the nucleoplasm and their influence on the aggressive traits of PDAC. The potential identification of a novel therapeutic target holds immense promise for addressing the daunting challenge of metastasis in PDAC patients, offering hope for improved clinical outcomes and enhanced quality of life.",

Entry into the cell cycle occurs only when sufficient growth has occurred and only when there are sufficient nutrients for further growth.  In animal cells, cell cycle entry is controlled by growth factors, which ensures that cell division occurs at an appropriate time and place.  Defects in the signals that control cell cycle entry are a primary cause of cancer.

The mechanisms that initiate cell cycle entry are poorly understood.  The critical molecular event that drives cell cycle entry is expression of late G1 phase cyclins.  Decades of work in both yeast and mammals led to a canonical model in which initiation of cell cycle entry occurs entirely via activation of late G1 phase cyclin transcription.  In this model, a cyclin expressed in early G1 phase activates a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk), which then phosphorylates and inactivates a repressor protein that inhibits transcription of late G1 phase cyclins.  In mammalian cells the repressor is the tumor suppressor Rb.  In yeast, the repressor is Whi5.  This model has been highly influential and has guided the field for decades, despite the existence of numerous observations that are difficult to reconcile with the model.  Moreover, recent tests of the model in both yeast and mammalian cells have shown that the model is inadequate and inaccurate.  The critical molecular events that initiate cell cycle entry remain largely unknown, which means that the mechanisms by which oncogenic signals influence cell cycle entry also remain unknown.

The goal of our work is to discover conserved molecular mechanisms that control cell cycle entry, which could lead to transformational breakthroughs in our understanding of how cell cycle entry is initiated, how it is influenced by oncogenic signals, and how cancer cells develop resistance to new drugs that target cell cycle entry.",

MYCN amplification is associated with significantly worse survival rates for children with NB, and MYCN amplifications in NB can be found both within the linear genome and on circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Amplifications of additional oncogenes in NB tumors, such as CDK4 and MDM2, have also been found on ecDNA, suggesting a broad role for ecDNA in NB pathogenesis. MYCN amplification via ecDNA has been linked to the presence of replication stress (RS), and RS is associated with defects in DNA replication and repair and is an important driver of tumor initiation and progression via induction of chromosomal instability. However, the role of RS and its significance as a potential therapeutic target in NB are unknown. We have established that MYCN-amplified NB cells demonstrate significantly increased sensitivity to inhibition of targets that generate increased RS compared to NB cells without MYCN amplification. We hypothesize that enhanced sensitivity of MYCN-amplified NB cells to induction of RS is due to a lethal increase in levels in RS beyond that induced by ecDNA formation and maintenance. Therefore, we propose to evaluate NB cells and tumors for the mechanisms of vulnerability to RS induction. We will investigate the contributions of MYCN amplification and expression and of ecDNA prevalence and content to sensitivity to RS induction in NB and evaluate the roles of MYCN- and ecDNA-induced RS in NB cell and tumor growth and response to treatment. Our proposed research will identify and validate novel approaches for targeting MYCN in NB via the unique strategy of targeting RS in a cancer cell-specific fashion. The proposed research will also facilitate future clinical trials and commercialization of novel inhibitors capable of inducing RS for treating MYCN-amplified NB tumors in need of less toxic and more effective therapies.",

SF3B1 is a core component of the spliceosome and an essential protein in the RNA splicing process.  Mutations in SF3B1 are a common cause of RNA dysregulation in multiple carcinomas and myeloid malignancies, and targeting the spliceosome has been evaluated in preclinical models and clinical trials.  On the other hand, aberrant expressions, not mutations, of SF3B1 are common in cancers, including sarcomas and lymphoid malignancies, suggesting the role of RNA splicing can be different in different cancers.  
Recently a study on aberrant RNA splicing and its potential as a therapeutic target in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was published. Aberrant RNA splicing has also been reported in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL); however, its role and therapeutic potential are not yet known. Our preliminary studies in B-ALL suggest that leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) that we discovered use unique RNA splicing as a survival mechanism and are sensitive to SF3B1 targeting.  Therefore, targeting leukemia cells, including LICs, has the potential to eradicate leukemia at its root.  LICs are believed to be the reason for disease relapse, and relapsed diseases still have very poor outcomes.  Our project has the potential to overcome the significant challenges of treating relapsed diseases.
We hypothesize that SF3B1 selectively regulates apoptosis-associated genes, and inhibition of SF3B1 induces cell death in B-ALL cells.  We will investigate the role of SF3B1 in B-ALL cell survival, particularly in LICs.  We will investigate the therapeutic potential of SF3B1 inhibition, with or without another drugs, both in vitro and in vivo, using our well-established, patient-derived high-risk B-ALL xenograft models.  
Understanding the role of RNA splicing in leukemia cell apoptosis in this project has the potential to lead to novel therapeutics to improve overall outcomes by decreasing treatment failure and relapse and has the potential to minimize negative side effects of current treatments by directing the therapy to LICs.  Adolescents and young adults with B-ALL have particularly poor outcomes.",

Within sarcomas, few therapeutic targets have been identified and those tested in clinical trials demonstrate limited efficacy. As a result, people with sarcoma have a 65% five-year survival rate despite aggressive multimodality treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Increasing our understanding of sarcoma biology, discovering new therapeutic vulnerabilities, and identifying opportunities for targeted therapies will improve patient outcomes.

We have developed a robust pre-clinical model that allows for the study of sarcoma development, growth, and metastasis across complex karyotype subtypes. Using this system, we identified oncogenic drivers of sarcoma development including Yes-associated protein (YAP). YAP amplification is observed across human sarcomas and was also observed in our pre-clinical model. YAP is a transcriptional regulator of the Hippo pathway that, in conjunction with coactivators controls development, differentiation, and cancer in context and cell specific manners. During the development of YAP driven tumors, we observed increased activity of Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2). This protein is a key component of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) that methylates histones at H3K27 and recruits methyltransferases resulting in a closed chromatin state. We hypothesize that EZH2 is required for the development and progression of YAP driven sarcomas. In this study, we will define the interaction between YAP and EZH2 during transformation and determine if therapeutic targeting of YAP and EZH2 is a feasible clinical strategy.

The era of targeted treatments and immunotherapy ushered in significant improvements in overall survival for patients with cancer. Despite this, the prognosis of high-grade complex karyotype sarcomas has remained stagnant. Inhibitors of YAP and Hippo signaling are under development and in clinical trials. Tazemetostat, an inhibitor of EZH2 is FDA approved for epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma. This study will be the first to investigate the role of YAP and EZH2 in complex karyotype sarcomas and validate these as therapeutic targets. The pre-clinical data from this study will inform future clinical trials for this aggressive and heterogenous tumor type.",

Overproduction or underproduction of histone protein can result in replication stress and genome instability that contribute to the development of cancer. The supply of histone proteins is primarily regulated at the level of replication-dependent (RD) histone mRNA production, a process that is tightly coupled to the phase of the cell cycle but remains incompletely understood. Here, we propose to investigate the mechanism of RD histone mRNA transcriptional termination, an enigmatic aspect of histone biogenesis with particular relevance to cancer formation. 
	RD histone mRNAs are the only eukaryotic mRNAs in animal cells that lack poly(A) tails, ending instead with a conserved stem-loop structure. The genes encoding all five RD histone proteins are clustered in metazoan genomes, and transcription and pre-mRNA processing factors required for histone mRNA biosynthesis are organized into a nuclear body (the histone locus body or HLB) that assembles at these gene clusters. Because of their close proximity to one another, transcription of each RD histone mRNA copy has to terminate shortly after the stem-loop; delayed termination akin to that seen with most polyadenylated mRNAs can lead to aberrant replication stress, aberrant gene transcription, and chromosomal instability, which are signature hallmarks of cancer. 
	In our preliminary studies, we found that acute depletion of RNase MRP - a ubiquitous and essential endonuclease known largely for its critical role in maturation of rRNAs – specifically affects termination of RD histone mRNA transcription. Here, we propose to investigate the requirement for the endonuclease activity of RNase MRP in RD histone mRNA termination and delineate the direct and indirect mechanisms by which compromised activity of RNase MRP could lead to deregulated production of histones and cancer development. This study will address one of the least understood aspects of histone gene regulation and shed light on the elevated risk of cancer development in patients with mutations in RNase MRP.",

LRF has been observed in about 45% of ablative radiotherapy recipients in the recent PACIFIC trial. These indicate that remission rate may be reduced by either local boosting in the definitive radiotherapy or focal salvage treatment. These failure patterns also allude to the criticality in ensuring that the ablative dose has been actually delivered to the intended treatment volume, a question to be answered with sophisticated monitoring that is currently absent. 
In this project, we propose to work with the widely accessible x-ray based on-board imaging (OBI) system. As X-ray collapses attenuation information along the beam direction, there is depth uncertainty and compromised conspicuity of the tumor target. Furthermore, the OBI is configured at a fixed angle to the treatment megavoltage beam, so its view angle is passively determined by the treatment trajectory, and typically does not offer the best visibility for tumor target or surrounding tissue context. The suboptimal region-of-interest (ROI) visibility is further compounded with the obstruction of high attenuating structures such as the rib(cage) along the x-ray beamline, drowning important lung texture.  To facilitate both online monitoring of the thorax anatomy, and spatiotemporal dose integration as quantitative evidence for adaptive SBRT, we will tailor neural field learning development with x-ray physics and geometry to (1) develop a physics and geometry informed view toggler to translate an online acquired OBI x-ray image to a clinically favorable angle with high GTV and context conspicuity (2) develop a virtual rib removing network to reveal the lung texture, and (3) Expand view toggler to full volumetric synthesizer to generate spatiotemporal anatomy for radiation dose accumulation.  
Success of this project will fill in the knowledge and clinical gap in fully monitoring the thorax dynamics during lung radiotherapy treatment, which has hindered the development and utilization of real-time adaptive control.  Accurate spatiotemporal dose accumulation not only provide informed prescription adaption but also provides more accurate actual dose to support radiobiological and outcome analysis to improve treatment regimen design.",

Yet, despite it’s profound importance, there are no clinical agents that directly target and inhibit Myc.  Efforts to develop small molecule Myc inhibitors have been hindered by a lack of suitable binding pockets on the protein.  Hence, Myc, like other transcription factors, has been considered “undruggable”.  We propose to take an entirely different approach to develop a Myc inhibitor.  Our approach will be based on the mechanism of Myc action and our prior success in developing a novel inhibitor of the “undruggable” transcription factor STAT3.  Myc exerts it’s effects by first heterodimerizing with Max.  Myc/Max then recognizes a unique, consensus DNA response element found in the promoter regions of Myc target genes.  Following binding to these response elements, Myc/Max induces the transcription of target genes that promote oncogenesis and resistance to chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy.  STAT3 oncoprotein similarly recognizes it’s own unique DNA response element.  We previously generated a potent, selective, and well-tolerated STAT3 inhibitor that mimics the STAT3 DNA response element, and is called cyclic STAT3 decoy (CS3D).  CS3D is a 15-bp double-stranded DNA molecule that is cyclized at both ends with hexaethylene glycolyl linkers.  CS3D binds STAT3 and competitively inhibits STAT3 binding to the promoter region of target genes, shutting down expression of these genes.  CS3D inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells and the growth of xenograft tumors following systemic delivery.  We hypothesize that cyclic oligonucleotide decoys can be developed to target and inhibit Myc/Max.  Three Aims are proposed.  In Aim 1 we will generate and optimize cyclic oligonucleotide decoys targeting Myc/Max and the functional capacity of the cyclic decoys to bind Myc/Max will be determined.  The optimal length and the specificity of each cyclic decoy will also be determined.  Aim 2 will determine the ability of an optimized Myc/Max cyclic decoy to inhibit Myc-mediated transcription using Myc/Max reporter constructs and a scrambled sequence version of the cyclic decoy as a control.  Aim 3 will investigate the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic properties of the Myc/Max cyclic decoy in Myc-dependent cells.",

Enhancers are genomic elements that control the timing, location, and levels of expression of a particular gene or genes, as such, enhancers provide the instructions for gene expression.  While there has been extensive focus on protein-coding variants and genomic changes that alter protein-coding regions, how enhancer variants contribute to cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to therapy is poorly studied. Enhancers harbor the majority of variants associated with diseases including cancers, but pinpointing causal variants is a major challenge because they are typically embedded within a sea of inert variants. This gap in our knowledge is stalling efforts to harness the full potential of genomic data to understand and treat cancer. A clear understanding of which enhancer variants contribute to various aspects of cancer is vital to understand the genetic basis of cancer initiation, progression, to develop novel therapeutics, improve diagnosis, and stratify patients for more targeted treatments. In this study, we will pilot a novel approach to identify enhancer variants that contribute to changes in gene expression in melanoma. We are experts in identifying causal variants within enhancers that alter gene expression and cellular identity within the context of the developing embryo. We have found that low-affinity binding sites are critical for precise control of gene expression. The prevalent use of low affinity sites within enhancers creates a vulnerability within genomes whereby SNVs can increase the affinity of binding sites within enhancers causing gain of function gene expression that alters cellular identity. We have demonstrated this in the context of heart and limb development. We now wish to apply this knowledge to gain insight into causal variants that contribute to various aspects of cancer. We plan to initially focus on metastasis, immunotherapy response and drug resistance in melanoma. In our preliminary study we have shown that an affinity optimizing SNVs found in a somatic melanoma eQTL increases expression of DAAM1 and increased cell migration. Successful completion of this project will uncover the contribution of enhancer variants to cancer progression and treatment.",

In the past the sex difference in melanoma has always been attributed to differential sex-associated UV behaviors.  Our epidemiological studies have recently revealed that the female sex itself is an independent risk factor for melanoma at younger age as compared to male sex.  A bimodal mechanism of melanomagenesis is proposed to explain the sex- and age-differentiated melanoma risk: melanoma diagnosed at older age is mainly attributed to solar UV exposure with sex as a modification factor; while sex independently and directly contributes to early onset melanoma in addition to UV exposure.  Our laboratory study suggested that testosterone enhanced DNA damage induced by solar-simulated radiation in normal human melanocytes, and estrogen induced differential ROS accumulation in melanocytes of different genders.  Our pilot case-control study suggested that salivary testosterone and estrogen levels exhibited an age- and sex-differentiated association with melanoma.  Hypothesis:  estrogen and testosterone play crucial roles in early onset melanoma in women and men, respectively: estrogen promotes melanomagenesis via ROS in young women and testosterone protects young men via enhancing UV-induced DNA damage repair. Sex hormones play less roles and UV play more important role in late onset melanoma.  In collaboration with clinicians and an experienced epidemiologist, we propose two specific aims:    Aim 1: validate the age- and gender-specific associations of estrogen and testosterone levels with melanoma risk using a case-control study design.   Aim 2: investigate the molecular mechanism of estrogen and testosterone in DNA damage repair in vitro in NHMs, and compare gender differences in a set of NHMs. This study is significant and novel as it is based on a new melanoma model, new discovery of salivary sex hormone association with melanoma and new role of testosterone in DNA damage in melanocytes.  Completion of this study will unveil the role of sex hormone in melanoma development, and may lead to paradigm change of future prevention strategies based on hormone levels which are modifiable by life style factors such as diet and physical activities.",

Lately, we have improved our understanding of this reaction by developing a homogeneous variant of the reaction. Now with an arsenal of homo- and heterogeneous catalytic conditions at our disposal, we are primed to develop new reductive reactions of functional groups abundant in organic compounds. Our aims are to use the water/diboron(4) system to 1) develop complementary methods for catalyst-controlled Pd-catalyzed trans- and cis-selective semihydrogenation and semideuteriation of alkynes; and 2) develop a mild reductive dehalogenation of haloarenes using H or D atoms from water.

The development of deuterium-containing small molecule organic pharmaceuticals is in its infancy, with the first notable deuterium drug analog (Austedo®) having received FDA approval in 2017 for the treatment of Huntington’s disease. Despite the recent FDA approval of Austedo®, many breakthrough medications remain inaccessible due to limitations in chemists’ ability to connect carbon and deuterium atoms efficiently and selectivity.

To chronically colonize, H. pylori must gain nutrients and avoid the immune response. Our preliminary work suggests H. pylori may do both by taking up lactate. H. pylori uses lactate as both a carbon/energy source, and our preliminary data suggests it promotes H. pylori’s resistance to the innate immune molecule complement. We became interested in lactate because it’s one of a handful of molecules that H. pylori seeks out using chemotaxis. In unpublished work, our lab and others also found that lactate is one of the most preferred carbon sources for H. pylori. Interestingly, lactate is produced to high amounts by cancer cells. They redirect their metabolism from aerobic respiration to aerobic glycolysis, the so-called Warburg effect. This metabolism results in the formation and excretion of high amounts of lactate. Indeed, studies have shown that gastric cancer resulted in elevated stomach lactate, as compared to normal stomachs. Altogether, these results suggest a model whereby H. pylori benefits at least in part from gastric carcinogenesis because of the elevated lactate. There are significant gaps in our understanding of how H. pylori metabolizes lactate. Our HYPOTHESIS is that H. pylori actively seeks, metabolizes, and uses lactate for both growth and for complement-based immune evasion. IN AIM 1, we will identify the H. pylori proteins required for lactate uptake and metabolism using genetic knockouts and phenotypic characterization. We will test these mutants in mouse and complement resistance models, to gain insight into the role of lactate utilization in these processes. In AIM 2, we will characterize whether H. pylori infection leads to an increase in lactate production in gastric cell and intact stomach models, and furthermore, whether lactate creation or utilization genes are correlated with cancerous outcomes.  Upon completion of this work, we will have a strong understanding of the pathways of H. pylori lactate uptake, and how it is metabolized for both growth and complement resistance. This work will allow us to develop biomarkers of lactate consumption that may also be good antibiotic targets, and may provide insight into the long-standing mystery of why H. pylori triggers gastric carcinogenesis.",

One big obstacle in the field is the difficulty of building relevant bladder cancer mouse models, since the bladder urothelial cells are extremely resistant to transformation by just one or two oncogenes and no good bladder-specific Cre line is available. TCGA analyses of muscle invasive bladder cancer have revealed the top recurrent mutated genes, and inactivating mutations in three epigenetic regulators KMT2D, KDM6A, and ARID1A are very common. Based on this finding and previous in vitro studies in the field, we hypothesize that these three epigenetic regulators are essential for preventing bladder cancer progression. To test it, we have developed a novel method of delivering DNA plasmids into the mouse urothelium through electroporation, and built a baseline p53 Pten mouse bladder cancer model by delivering the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids targeting those two genes. Our preliminary histology and sequencing data showed that this approach can reliably generate bladder tumors with advanced-stage carcinoma in situ, and that the resulting tumors can be clonally derived from individual mutant cells. We will therefore build gRNA plasmids targeting various combinations of the three chromatin-remodeling genes, and co-deliver them with the p53 Pten plasmid. We will perform histological analyses of the bladder tumors for different groups of mice at early and later time points, and determine whether further mutating any combinations of Kmt2d, Kdm6a, and Arid1a genes will promote bladder cancer progression. In sum, by developing and validating a novel CRISPR-based cancer modeling approach, my lab is well positioned to do complex genetic modeling of bladder cancer in vivo and study the molecular mechanisms. With the CRCC seed funding, this study has promise of revealing a driver’s role for key epigenetic regulators, and should lead to future NIH grant applications.","The goal of the project is to determine the role of three chromatin-remodeling genes in bladder cancer progression by building and characterizing CRISPR-based mouse bladder cancer models. Three specific aims were proposed: (1) to characterize a baseline model targeting the genes Tp53 and Pten; (2) to build CRISPR bladder cancer models targeting the chromatin-remodeling genes Kmt2d, Kdm6a, and Arid1a; (3) to evaluate how the chromatin-remodeling genes modulate bladder cancer progression compared to the baseline model. We have completed Aims1 and 2, and already discovered key new findings while working towards the completion of Aim 3. Specifically, in the first two aims, we determined the kinetics of the baseline cancer model progression through time, and constructed the DNA vectors necessary for building CRISPR models and delivered them to the mouse bladder. For Aim 3, we have compared the tumor histology of Arid1a CRISPR model with the baseline model and discovered that Arid1a mutation significantly accelerated cancer progression. We have also used single cell RNA-sequencing to identify various tumor cell populations in the Arid1a CRISPR model. These results successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our approach of combining CRISPR technique with electroporation delivery, and showed that simultaneously targeting multiple genes in the bladder in vivo to dissect their functions is possible. A manuscript describing our findings about the Arid1a gene is currently in preparation, and we expect to submit it for peer review by the end of 2021. In addition, I used the data collected from this project as preliminary data for a grant application to the American Cancer Society, and was awarded in 2020 a four-year grant totaling $792,000 to study the cell of origin of bladder cancer. Going forward, we will continue to characterize the Arid1a cancer model at the single cell level to determine why Arid1a mutation accelerated cancer progression. We will also expand these investigations to other chromatin-remodeling genes to determine whether they play similar roles in bladder cancer progression."

In addition, CO appears to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. We have recently shown that that small doses of CO from designed CO-releasing molecules (photoCORMs) can be conveniently used to induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells cells in a dose-dependent manner through controlled CO release. We now plan to determine whether such co-administration of exogenous CO increases the efficacy of chemotoxic drugs in the treatment of solid cancers (consequently minimizing treatment-related adverse events).    We will utilize in-vitro and in-vivo models of breast and ovarian cancer for our investigation towards assessing the effects of exogenous CO applications.   (1) We will determine the optimal concentrations of photoCORMs in diminishing cell proliferation of breast and ovarian cancer cells in-vitro and in xenograft models, in the presence of various doses of commonly used chemotoxic drugs, and   (2) We will investigate the detailed mechanism(s) of CO-mediated inhibition of antioxidant pathways in breast and ovarian cancer cells in-vitro and in xenograft models. In both aims, use of photoCORMs will allow delivery of precise doses of CO and study its effects under very controlled conditions.    In a recent paper [1],  we have shown that CO delivery from our photoCORMs selectively inhibits cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS, a heme protein) and attenuates the antioxidant capacity of human breast cancer cells. In cancer, CBS plays a significant role in drug resistance; silencing CBS expression could sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. Our results also demonstrated that exogenous CO delivery significantly increased the chemosensitivity of human breast cancer cells toward both Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel. We therefore plan to further explore the mechanism of CO-induced enhancement of chemotoxicity in both breast and ovarian cancer cells (especially cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells). We believe that along with CBS, there could be other pathways also involved, for example metallothionein (MT) expression. This is a new venture in my research group and we plan to write a RO1 grant once we have more initial results to support our hypothesis.    1. J. Med. Chem. 2017, 60, 8000-8010.","The goal of this project was to examine the role of carbon monoxide (CO) in the process of sensitization of chemotherapy in human. Emergence of drug resistance is a major impediment to conventional chemotherapy and often leads to poor therapy outcome. In our research we have investigated the role of CO in the inhibition of enzymes responsible for maintaining the redox homeostasis in cancer cells since a healthy level of reducing power is required for proper function of cells in general. Our results have revealed that inhibition of the enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase by CO results in imbalance of the concentrations of cysteine and glutathione that leads to enhancement of drug-induced ROS activity in cancer cell and cell death. We have also shown that CO interferes with the Cytochrome P450 enzymes, an action that enhances the drug effects of common therapeutics in cancer therapy. So far we have utilized a photoactive CO donor that allowed us to deliver selected doses of CO to target cells under the control of light. We have incorporated such CO donors in biocompatible mesoporous silica nanoparticles to further demonstrate the utility of CO delivery in cancer therapy.  in animal models. In a preliminary study (collaboration with UCSD), administration of the drug-bearing nanoparticles into xenografts on mice has led to particle accumulation and exposure to light has resulted in significant reduction in tumor load. Collectively, results of our research demonstrate that (a) the outcome of cancer chemotherapy could be improved with co-administration of CO and (b) CO could be delivered selectively to the tumor site by the CO-bearing nanoparticles followed by illumination."

Two PFAS chemicals were recently classified as carcinogenic to humans, with the strongest associations being with kidney and testicular cancers. High levels of PFAS have been measured in the blood of firefighters and studies suggest that firefighters have a higher cancer risk compared to the general population. PFAS may possibly enter firefighters’ bodies through combustion of treated consumer products, contact with turnout gear, aqueous film-forming foam, and air and dust at fire stations. The Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA) and UC Irvine have partnered on this proposal to improve our understanding of PFAS exposures among OCFA firefighters. We previously collaborated on research related to COVID-19. This proposal reflects the cancer concerns of OC firefighters and the expertise of UC Irvine researchers. 

OCFA and UC Irvine are working together to measure PFAS levels in OCFA firefighters’ blood, determine PFAS exposure from combustion among live fire training instructors, and assess indoor PFAS exposures in fire stations and fire trucks. We will measure PFAS in firefighters' blood in coordination with the OCFA annual required tuberculosis testing of ~1000 firefighters. Results will be reported back to firefighters with an educational plan to minimize PFAS exposure, reduce cancer risk, and evaluate their exposure and cancer risks relative to other firefighters, OC residents, and general U.S. population. Firefighters with high PFAS blood levels will be invited to participate in an  intervention to reduce PFAS levels by donating blood. To assess combustion sources of PFAS exposure, we will closely monitor firefighters in the OCFA burn cadre, a high-exposure group within the fire service, using silicone wristbands and repeat blood measures over time. Lastly, we will collect and analyze air and dust in fire stations and fire trucks to determine if firefighters are potentially exposed from these indoor environment. Our work will contribute to a better understanding of PFAS  sources that inform the development of approaches for reducing exposure and cancer risk among firefighters.",

Our project aims to identify early cancer blood biomarkers, called the Firefighter Early Biomarker (FEB) panel, which uses a blood test to detect early signs of cancer caused by these exposures.
Collaborative Elements: This research involves a close partnership between wildfire health researchers at UC Davis, the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD), and the broader California fire service community. By working together, we aim to create practical solutions that can be quickly adopted to protect firefighters' health.
Research Questions and Central Hypotheses: We aim to answer whether repeated exposure to fire-related chemicals leads to detectable changes in firefighters' blood that indicate an increased risk of cancer. We hypothesize that certain changes to DNA, called DNA methylation, can serve as early warning signs of cancer, and these changes can be measured and monitored over time.
General Methodology: Our study will collect blood samples from firefighters before and after they participate in training exercises. We will analyze these samples to identify specific DNA methylation changes linked to exposure to harmful chemicals. We will also compare the effects of different exposure levels by analyzing samples from new recruits and experienced instructors who face different frequencies of exposure.
Innovative Elements and Potential Impact: This project is innovative because it uses advanced genomic technologies to develop a blood test that can detect early cancer signs specific to firefighters' unique exposures. By identifying these early markers, we can implement timely interventions to reduce exposure and ultimately lower the risk of cancer. The potential impact is significant, as this approach could lead to policy changes within fire departments and improve the long-term health and safety of firefighters across California and beyond.
Our community-based approach ensures that the research is grounded in the real-world experiences and needs of firefighters. By directly involving firefighters in the study and its interventions, we aim to create practical and effective solutions that will have a lasting impact on their health and well-being.",

These hazards embody key characteristics of carcinogens by inducing epigenetic alterations and oxidative stress. The impact of personal protections and administrative/engineering controls on mitigating the cancer impact of these hazards has not previously been directly assessed. This study seeks to provide new knowledge by establishing a study that will follow a group of 647 California firefighters for 12 months. Firefighters will be asked to participate in repeated blood sample collections, body composition analysis, diet assessments, questionnaires about diverse topics (such as job classification and duties, workplace environment and practices, and physical, mental, and social health), clinical tests, and continuous monitoring of physical activity, heart rate, and sleep. Cancer risk and protective factors will be examined together with key cancer biomarkers that can gauge the importance of each individual and combination of factors on cancer risk. Selected biomarkers represent two hallmarks of cancer, epigenetic reprogramming and tumor-promoting inflammation. The central hypothesis is that cancer in firefighters is the result of the combined impact of a multitude of occupational-related hazards, many of which are modifiable targets for cancer prevention. Rigorous epidemiological studies such as this one are required to determine the directional association between these hazards and cancer risk in order to develop the most effective, accepted, and sustainable interventions. This study will be informed by collaborative, bi-directional input from fire service stakeholders through a community-based participatory research model and has the potential to prompt numerous actions to protect firefighters from cancer. The study results will provide firefighters knowledge that impacts their perceived susceptibility, thus empowering and motivating implementation of personal exposure reducing interventions, provide management data to develop and prioritize systems-level interventions to reduce cancer risk, and provide fire service leadership and policy makers an evidence base to advocate for funding to support cancer protective measures.",

This project will develop a close research partnership between the San Marcos Professional Firefighters Association and social scientists from the University of California, Riverside.  We will integrate our insights, expertise, and professional skills to identify specific challenges, design and implement effective educational programs and intervention procedures, and generate novel insights and knowledge for cancer prevention.

We aim to address a series of questions, including how firefighters perceive their cancer risks and the main causes of cancer in their work; how personal background and attributes, group dynamics, and organizational culture affect firefighters’ perceptions and working practices (such as use, storage, and cleaning of protective equipment); and the effectiveness of organizational initiatives and educational programs for cancer prevention.

We will observe firefighters’ working practices and further conduct interviews and surveys to understand the social dynamics shaping firefighters’ perceptions and practices related to carcinogenic exposures.  We will undertake a new organizational initiative to provide multi-cancer early detection tests, develop a series of educational programs, and improve organizational policies on cancer prevention.  We will further examine their effectiveness in changing firefighters’ perceptions and behaviors and reducing cancer risks.

While we know that these exposures can cause cancer, we don’t understand exactly how the cancer comes about and which of these chemicals or particles is the worst culprit. We did some testing in the lab and found that cells in the airways that are exposed to woodfire smoke develop changes that cause them to divide too much and could lead to cancer. We also found that air in the fire station can activate pathways that lead cells to divide too much. Here we plan to purchase 5 new firefighter jackets for Fire Station 3 and recruit 5 firefighters to wear, monitor and track this gear and record what it is exposed to. They will also send it to us at UCLA every 2 months for testing. We will extract the chemicals and particles and traces of heavy metals from the jackets to characterize and quantify them .

Cancer within the Fire Service is a leading cause for firefighter deaths both during active careers and after retirement likely from the accumulated carcinogen exposure and the relatively long time that tumors can develop before being detected. Cancer is the result of accumulated cellular damage that changes a cell from a normal state to a cancerous state with uncontrolled growth. Many carcinogens damage DNA leading to these changes. By looking at the DNA isolated from the cells within tumors, we can see the changes made to the DNA by these carcinogens. The changes made are not random, so each carcinogen leaves a tell-tale signature on the DNA. By analyzing these signatures, this project aims to identify which carcinogens of the many firefighters are exposed to over their career are most likely to cause the cancer DNA causing damage. Focusing on tumors arising in firefighters will enrich for these signatures making them more recognizable than within tumors collected from the general population. Knowing specifically which carcinogens, of the many, are most likely to have damaged the DNA leading to these tumors will enable better practices for limiting exposure through training and changes to protocols and protective gear.

Firefighters undergo routine trainings to practice extinguishing fires over the course of several weeks. During training , firefighters are exposed to toxic gases and particulate matter found in the smoke that fires generate. These airborne chemicals are known to cause cancer and put our firefighters at risk. Through this proposal, we will modify training exercises to reduce exposure to these cancer causing pollution, making trainings safer for firefighters across California.

COLLABORATIVE ELEMENTS
To investigate exposures firefighters face, scientists from UC Davis have already been collaborating with the LA County Fire Department, having developed tools firefighters use to collect air samples while they fight fires. In this work, UC Davis and LA County Fire Department will deploy these tools during live fire training events, and collect biospecimens. We will identify live fire training exercises that caused exposure in firefighters, then change these activities to reduce exposures. Then, LA County firefighters will educate other firefighters across California on how to make training safer.

CENTRAL RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS
By deploying tools developed by UC Davis, we hypothesize that through educating live fire instructors across California, we can teach firefighters statewide about methods proven to protect themselves from fire-induced airborne carcinogens, and that new recruits will continue to practice these methods throughout their careers. 

METHODOLOGY
The LA County Fire Department will collect air samples during live fire trainings, and collect samples of their exhaled breath, urine, and a swab of their skin. These samples will be examined by UC Davis scientists for evidence of exposure to cancer causing compounds and particulate matter. Working together, we will determine whether new ways of training firefighters reduce their exposure to these compounds while still meeting the objective of the training activity, producing healthy and well-trained firefighters in California.

POTENTIAL IMPACT
Long term, we hope to reduce the incidence of cancer among California firefighters. By educating firefighters about the risks of being exposed to airborne cancerous compounds at the earliest part of their career, firefighters can continue to practice these methods long term, protecting themselves and reducing the likelihood of developing cancer.",

PrEP, if used as directed, could virtually eliminate the risk of HIV acquisition among high risk populations. In addition to the brick and mortar sites, the state of California provides PrEP delivered through telemedicine (telePrEP) at no cost for those enrolled in their PrEP Assistance Program (PrEP-AP). Program participants enroll by visiting a local enrollment site once and then follow up visits, testing, and prescription filling occur remotely without visiting a clinic. However, this option is underutilized, with only a small number of people using telemedicine to get PrEP. The goal of this implementation science proposal is to develop an intervention which increases  uptake of California’s telePrEP program (referred to as “Cal telePrEP” for this proposal). The study will occur in two phases. First, we will work with community based organizations, health policy stakeholders, industry stakeholders and prospective patients to identify barriers and facilitators to the uptake of telePrEP among Latinx MSM and transwomen. Data on barriers and facilitators will be collected through qualitative data collection methods (focus groups and in-depth interviews), and the development of interview/focus group guides, as well as the analysis of subsequent data, will be guided by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework. We will then analyze the data and present our findings to a stakeholder board. This board will consist of community organizations and health policy organizations that will help us develop a set of recommendations for increasing access to telePrEP. 
During the second phase, we will select local PrEP-AP enrolling sites in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernandino counties and we will work closely with their staff to implement the recommendations from the first phase. We will use a second framework called the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) to evaluate our intervention by monitoring telePrEP uptake on a quarterly basis.
Finally, project findings and a set of recommendations will be shared with local sites, stakeholders and PrEP providers to assist with expanding telePrEP use among Latinx populations in California.","The California PrEP Assistance Program, sponsored by the state, offers free PrEP through telemedicine, but it has not been widely used by Latinx communities. The research consisted of two phases. In Phase 1 (Assessment Phase), this proposal aimed to evaluate the current program through discussions with community members and stakeholders, and based on the findings, a Stakeholder Review Board made up of community advocates, policy makers, and industry stakeholders would provide recommendations to inform our Phase 2, or the adoption of the PrEP-AP's telemedicine program with Plushcare. Phase 2 involved testing the recommended interventions through a controlled trial and assess their impact in promoting the telemedicine program among Latinx communities. However, the contract between CDPH and the telemedicine provider, Plushcare, expired on December 31, 2021, leading CHRP to request a revision and resubmission of a Phase 2 proposal. In May 2022, we conducted 13 interviews and 13 focus groups of 29 total participants. We analyzed the data, organized it, and presented preliminary findings to a Stakeholder Review Board of 35 attendees in August 2022. The review board results emphasized the need to improve the user interface and experience, increase the number of enrollment sites in rural areas such as San Bernardino and Riverside, and raise awareness of the program. Given the limitations of our study and the time constraint, we created bilingual materials and pilot-tested various interventions aimed at raising awareness among Latinx populations through social media platforms like TikTok and online dating applications like Grindr from September to November 2022. After solidifying the potential intervention into a revised proposal submitted to CHRP in December 2022, CHRP’s review concluded an early termination of research activities effective on January 31, 2023."

We the People outlines a concrete, inter-sectional, actionable plan to end HIV for all communities, recognizing that current efforts are leaving far too many people behind.  We intend to use this framework to inform all of the work of this Center including both HIV/AIDS and Tobacco-related health disparities policy work.","This CHRP grant aids in the development of research and policy proposals that are informed by the community to promote continued learning and awareness of the ongoing circumstances that affect people living with HIV. This grant is unique in that it relies heavily on community advised conversations to better inform researchers. A central component of this work is the community-based, participatory research conducted through the We The People (WTP) Research Center. The specific goals of the We The People HIV Policy Research Center includes composing four annual rapid response policy briefs with the framework of combining both academic and community expertise into all elements of the development and dissemination process. In 2022, continued work on Rapid Response Policy Papers transpired and, currently, there are 13 Rapid Response Policy Papers in progress at various stages of the research process. Ongoing research will continue in its original objective of expanding the policy discourse surrounding HIV and tobacco through evidence-based research, while upholding the lens of marginalized communities. Other topics of HIV-related research topical areas include papers related to: transgender violence, public health policy related to PrEP and ART treatment, the intersection of COVID, HIV and mental health, and various public policy related to HIV (including SB159, SB306, STD Coverage and are Act, among others), MonkeyPox sexual risk assessment, pharmacy treatment of sexual and gender minorities, among others.  Specifically, a total of 13 Rapid Response Policy Papers are currently in progress, and whose work will be continued into the next year of funding. 

During the grant cycle, BAI experienced strategic, yet challenging transitions in various leadership roles and team member positions. These staff transitions resulted in short periods of insufficient management and collaboration with our Co-PIs. However, with careful and strategic hires, we were able to develop and maintain a schedule and work plan that allowed our Center to become current with deliverables from the previous grant cycle. As mentioned in a previous report, research-specific obstacles include the convening of our advisory board and stakeholder engagement with limited community-engagement. APEB’s role as a partner in our Center’s Executive Team, supporting the process of developing policy responses - and the infrastructure for a community-led voice in our work remains a challenge. In response to this challenge and in the midst of BAI leadership transitions, the Co-PIs and Co-Is maintained momentum of their research by sourcing and integrating the community into the Centers' work. Unfortunately, these obstacles remain in place and BAI intends to reimagine the suitability, management of, and utility of the CAB to support the Center’s research moving forward.

Specifically, we will make anti-HIV T cells (called CAR-T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor T cells) that we genetically engineer to not become exhausted by targeting the expression of genes that control T cell exhaustion. We will target one gene that we have found gives anti-HIV T cells the ability to proliferate robustly when they encounter HIV. Using CRISPR technology for gene editing, we will then target several other genes that we hypothesize may have a similar effect based on our preliminary studies in T cells isolated from people with HIV who naturally control the infection and have highly functional anti-HIV T cells. Finally, we are proposing to develop a novel system in the laboratory that will allow us to evaluate the function of anti-HIV CAR-T cells in lymph nodes, the natural environment where HIV-infected cells persist in the body. Our studies will help us to identify and test new targets to improve the function of anti-HIV T cells for HIV cure.","HIV is an infection for which there is no cure. Many approaches to curing HIV seek to harness the power of anti-HIV T cells that are able to specifically recognize and kill cells in the body that are infected with HIV. Because T cells can become dysfunctional - or “exhausted” - during chronic HIV infection, we need to find approaches that prevent anti-HIV T cells from losing their function. Here, we proposed to test cutting-edge approaches to overcome anti-HIV T cell exhaustion. Specifically, we are making anti-HIV T cells (called CAR-T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor T cells) genetically engineered to overcome exhaustion. In the process of undertaking this research project, we recognized that we needed to first optimize how the CAR-T cells were “seeing” their antigen, so we focused on making the cells in such a way that they could see infected cells that are less visible to the immune system (due to low antigen levels). We also engineered the cells to be less likely to become exhausted based on where we inserted the gene for the CAR receptor (into the endogenous TCR – TRAC – locus). We did this, and improved the ability of edited T cells to recognize and kill HIV Env-expressing cells. During the first year of the award, we optimized the conditions for culturing lymph node tissue for long periods of time in our lab, which will be helpful for future studies of engineered HIV-specific T cells. Our studies will help us to identify and test new targets to improve the function of anti-HIV T cells for HIV cure."

HIV-1 infection generally increases T-cell metabolism, which means that cells are more active, which promotes successful viral integration and replication. Our preliminary data show that although therapeutic T cell vaccination can effectively generate cytotoxic “killer” T cells that kill HIV-infected cells, in most cases this antiviral activity is insufficient to limit viral replication. It is critical to improve upon these promising vaccine strategies and to design novel approaches for enhancing vaccine-induced immunity. Given intriguing data indicating that rapamycin, a drug that targets T-cell metabolism and is used at high doses as an immunosuppressive agent, can enhance the magnitude and the quality of vaccine-induced virus specific memory T cells, we hypothesized that stringent post-treatment control requires both effective anti-SIV responses to a therapeutic vaccine and unfavorable metabolic conditions for viral replication. Here we propose to modulate the mTOR pathway during antiretroviral therapy interruption, to reduce T-cell activation and the avaliability of new target cells, and during vaccination, to enhance SIV-specific cellular immunity. To achieve our goal, we will investigate two important effects of rapamycin in rhesus macaques; 1) its effect in controlling inflammation and immune activation and 2) its ability to create effective T-cell responses in recipients of therapeutic vaccination.","(1) Most people living with HIV (PWH) see the virus return quickly if they stop taking antiretroviral drugs. The goal of this project is to provide the improved anti-SIV T-cell function that is needed for post-treatment control by using mTOR inhibitors to create the metabolic conditions required for the development of fully functional CTL. We hypothesize that such CTLs have stem-like characteristics that allow robust expansion in the presence of any virus that emerges after ART withdrawal.
(2) Six non-controller macaques were placed back on ART, treated with either rapamycin or metformin, and therapeutically vaccinated with mRNA/LNPs expressing the SIV gag gene. Contrary to expectations, rapamycin treatment diminished memory CD8+ T-cell responses and did not prevent viral rebound upon ART interruption. In contrast, the mRNA/metformin combination resulted in a significant increase in the magnitude of CD8+ T-cell responses and some level of post-treatment control. Rapamycin treatment negatively impacted the expansion of both effector and memory CD8+ T-cells.
(3) During the reporting period, we encountered no significant challenges or barriers that impeded our research.
(4) We found evidence supporting our hypothesis that moderate mTOR inhibition (e.g., using metformin) allows for a qualitatively superior T-cell response to therapeutic vaccination and improved post-treatment control. Rapamycin, however, limited the expansion of virus-specific T cells and had a detrimental effect during ATI, possibly due to over-inhibition of mTOR by this drug. 
(5) Future studies will ask if continued moderate mTOR inhibition after ART interruption can support enhanced T-cell function and viral control over a longer period. We will also test the combination of mRNA vaccination in the presence of metformin with concomitant reservoir depletion as an HIV cure strategy."

David Gladstone Institutes,,CHRP Basic Biomedical Sciences,Basic biomedical sciences,"The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) attacks our body’s immune system by infecting a specific type of immune cells called CD4 T-cells. If left untreated, the destruction of CD4 cells makes it difficult for the body to fight infections, a condition known as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Despite 40 years of research, we still do not have a cure for HIV. Current anti-HIV drugs (also known as antiretrovirals) keep the virus under control but cannot eliminate it from the body, necessitating a life-long dependence on these drugs. However, some rare HIV-positive individuals can stay symptom-free and disease-free for years without any antiretroviral therapy and are called elite controllers or HIV long-term non-progressors. If we can crack the mystery of how these individuals keep HIV under control without drugs, then we can use that knowledge to find a cure for HIV. In some of these HIV controllers, it was found that their CD8 T-cells, another type of immune cells important for killing virus-infected cells in the body, can somehow stop the HIV virus from multiplying in the HIV-infected CD4 cells, without killing the latter. This phenomenon is called CD8 T cell non-cytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR). CD4 cell numbers are usually maintained well in such patients and they do not develop symptoms of immune deficiency. We aim to understand how CD8 cells stop HIV replication in CD4 cells. In the proposed project, we will use a type of molecular scissors called CRISPR-Cas9 to cut and mutate the genes of HIV-infected CD4 cells. This pool of mutated CD4 cells will be grown with CD8 cells from i) elite HIV controllers, ii) regular HIV patients, and/or iii) healthy individuals. If deletion of certain gene(s) in CD4 cells inhibits the antiviral activity of CD8 cells, then we can infer involvement of these genes in the antiviral response. In this study, we propose a method to delete all 20,000 human genes in CD4 cells at once and check their effect on the anti-viral activity of CD8 cells. The knowledge gained from these experiments can direct us towards a cure for HIV.","Some rare HIV-positive individuals stay disease-free for years without any antiretroviral therapy. Their CD8+ T-cells inhibit HIV replication in infected CD4+ T-cells without killing them. This CD8+ T-cell non-cytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR) is associated with the secretion of an unknown CD8+ cell antiviral factor (CAF). The goal of the current study is to develop a better understanding of this antiviral response by the development of appropriate high-throughput gene-editing methods (CRISPR). We developed and adapted a genetic screening method using which we can infect primary human CD4+ T cells with the HIV-CRISPR virus to delete all 20,000 human genes at once and study their role in CNAR/CAF activity. We also developed an assay to delete one gene at a time in HIV-infected cells to validate the role of potential regulators of CNAR/CAF activity. We optimized assays to screen samples with high antiviral activity and identified several fluids with strong antiviral activity required for the proposed experiments. During the final year of the grant, we performed several CRISPR screens to study the role of every single human protein-coding gene in HIV infection with a CXCR4 tropic virus and have identified several novel potent antiviral and proviral factors. Some of these antiviral factors are predicted to be secreted out of cells and therefore can be therapeutically important and might be involved in the CNAR/CAF pathway. The screens to specifically uncover the novel regulators involved in this antiviral response are currently underway and we plan to continue working on them. Some of the methods developed through support from this grant are described in our recent paper in mBio (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02222-23). The manuscript describing the results from the first few HIV-CRISPR screens is currently under review in Science."

Despite the advent of anti-retroviral therapy, HIV remains a major public health concern: we still lack treatments to achieve a functional or sterilizing cure, as the virus can integrate into the host genome and remain latent for decades.
The discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, allowing precise and efficient gene editing brought a new tool to the HIV cure field. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing allows mutational inactivation of HIV promoter or gene sequences and host-dependency factors such as HIV coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5. This system is currently being tested in an HIV cure-focused clinical trial. However, little is known about the ability of this system to efficiently edit HIV latently-infected cells in vivo. Latency is maintained through several mechanisms. Among these mechanisms, DNA methylation and chromatin condensation are of particular importance. DNA methylation is a mechanism through which methyl groups are transferred to cytosines in the CpG context to silence gene expression. Chromatin condensation is a mechanism that keeps DNA compact in a cell, and modulation of its state is directly correlated with gene expression: open chromatin regions tend to be transcriptionally active and closed regions are silenced. Both mechanisms contribute to viral silencing in latently-infected cells. However, several reports have shown that closed chromatin and methylated CpG impedes CRISPR-Cas9 editing.
In this project, we propose to use epigenetic modulators to enhance anti-HIV CRISPR Cas9 editing in primary CD4+ T cells ex vivo.  We will treat CD4+ T cells with methylation inhibitors or histone deacetylase inhibitors, involved in chromatin condensation, nucleofect treated cells with anti-HIV Cas9 ribonucleoproteins, and evaluate gene editing efficiency using Tracking of Indels by Decomposition analysis. In addition, we will study the role of CpG islands in the HIV provirus in CD4+ T cells using the CRISPRoff/Tet system, allowing targeted methylation or demethylation. We will apply targeted bisulfite sequencing and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) in parallel to evaluate the methylation and the chromatin state at targeted sites.
Our project will improve our understanding of HIV latency and take anti-HIV gene therapy a step closer to the clinic by enhancing its efficiency.",

To date, mostly due to the extremely difficult accessibility of this area, data on HIV reservoir in human spinal cord is rare. This gap limits our possibility of designing effective strategies to target and eradicate the virus. In fact, differences among HIV reservoirs exist across the human body, and even a single site, where HIV reservoir can behave differently compared to others better characterized (e.g., brain, gut), can contribute to unexpected and unwanted outcomes of any curative attempt. 2) By investigating the relationship between the inflammation in cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the CNS) and the HIV reservoir in spinal cord, we will describe the contribution of this reservoir in fueling local activation of immune cells. Chronic inflammation occurs even when ART blocks HIV replication, and can cause mood, cognitive and neurological disorders. Our data will inform interventional strategies to modulate the inflammation behind HIV neuropathogenesis. 3) By describing the relationship between HIV reservoir, inflammation, and the levels of antiretrovirals in the spinal cord, we will provide data on the penetration and activity of antiretrovirals in this CNS region. Antiretrovirals penetration and activity both change according to drug and body region, with clinically important differences also across distinct brain areas, but largely unknown for spinal cord. This information will help in interpreting the other findings of this proposal and can better inform on the choice of ART when aiming for more neuro-protective or less neurotoxic regimens. We will do all this thanks to 15 altruistic PWH with a life-shortening illness that chose to participate in HIV cure research at the end-of-life (Last Gift program), including full body donation for a rapid research autopsy.",

Antiretroviral drugs can inhibit HIV infection, but cannot eliminate the latently infected cells in the body that hide from the immune system.  Developing an HIV cure requires the elimination of latently infected cells. To achieve this, this proposal is focused on strategies to eliminate these hidden reservoirs and accurately quantify their presence. By deepening our understanding of HIV latency, this proposal aims to explore new treatments targeting these cells. One potential avenue is enhancing the function and survival of natural killer cells, which have the inherent ability to target virally infected cells and are better tolerated than T cell-based therapies. This research utilizes a combination of novel chimeric antigen receptors designed to improve natural killer cell survival and function. Additionally, cutting-edge technologies such as genetic barcoded virus systems and deep sequencing multi-omic platforms enable the tracking of individual HIV clones as they circulate or hide within T cells. These advancements hold promise in advancing our knowledge of HIV latency and developing more effective treatments for cure.",

For this reason, PWH must maintain their medication regimen for the duration of their lives, as stopping the medication will result in a rebound of the viral infection and the development of AIDS. The main barrier to a cure is the fact that the virus will hide in a person's DNA in tissues throughout the entire body, and we neither understand the mechanisms that control its re-expression from the DNA, nor how to reach these tissues outside the blood with effective therapy. Since the virus integrates into the DNA of the cells it infects, it becomes subject to the same mechanisms as those controlling the expression of human genes, and these mechanisms provide this control through impacting the 3D structure of the DNA. Therefore, we propose to characterize how the integration of the viral DNA affects the way HIV DNA interacts with the rest of the genome on a 3D level, alongside the types of molecular modifications that are made to the DNA to regulate viral expression. First, I am proposing experiments to understand these mechanisms in a cell model of latent infection using new and innovative technologies that enable evaluation in individual cells. Next, I propose to examine them in tissues of people from the 'Last Gift' cohort, which is a unique cohort of altruistic PWH who agree to donate their bodies for a rapid autopsy after they die of non-AIDS-related illnesses. Data are already being generated from the 'Last Gift' that allows us to examine viral genetic sequences, where the virus is located in the DNA, and which types of cells it is infecting throughout the body. Therefore, the data from this proposal will be integrated alongside these pre-existing data to provide a more complete picture of how we can target the virus to achieve a cure.",

Long-acting injectable (LAI) PrEP offers a promising and preferred strategy for PWUD, yet effective interventions to improve linkage and retention in HIV preventive care are urgently needed. To develop best practices for engaging PWUD in LAI-PrEP services, we propose enrolling participants to receive LAI-PrEP via two novel recruitment methods: (1) community-based recruitment and service delivery via collaboration between the Harm Reduction Coalition of San Diego (HRCSD) and UCSD’s Owen Clinic and (2) hospital-based recruitment and referral to the Owen Clinic via a dedicated Care Navigator. First, the community-based outreach method will consist of mobile LAI-PrEP services provided at various community locations in conjunction with harm reduction services provided by the HRCSD; this partnership will support expanding the HRCSD’s services to include LAI-PrEP, which will be offered to all eligible and interested PWUD. Second, our hospital-based recruitment method will leverage the Owen Clinic’s proximity to UCSD’s Hillcrest Medical Center, a safety net hospital where many PWUD receive care; eligible individuals will be referred to initiate PrEP. Study participants at either site will receive comprehensive screening and treatment for HIV, HCV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and referrals for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and behavioral therapies for SUD at baseline and at bimonthly follow-up visits. In total, we will enroll 200 PWUD to receive LAI-PrEP (n=100 via UCSD Hillcrest Medical Center hospital-based recruitment and n=100 via HRCSD’s mobile community-based outreach). We hypothesize that compared with traditional care models, mobile service delivery will demonstrate higher retention in care (45% of persons starting PrEP continue PrEP at 26 weeks, defined as having received two doses of LAI-PrEP following baseline enrollment). We further hypothesize that PWUD receiving medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and LAI-PrEP will be more likely to be retained in care for PrEP at 26 weeks when compared to persons using LAI-PrEP alone. Embedded in these outcomes, we intend to demonstrate the feasibility of dedicated provision of LAI-PrEP among PWUD as an ongoing and sustainable strategy in order to end the HIV epidemic.","The study aims to expand access to long-acting injectable PrEP (LAI-PrEP) for people who use drugs (PWUD) through community-based recruitment and mobile service delivery.

To date, we have achieved several milestones, including protocol development/approval, staffing and finalizing the subaward with our community partner, Harm Reduction Coalition of San Diego (HRCSD). A survey instrument has been developed to capture key participant-level data surrounding substance use, demographics and personal/sexual health. Pre-implementation outreach has been extensive and has included engagement with key community organizations, service providers and networking meetings. Last, we have secured a mobile medical van, fully equipped to provide confidential medical assessments and facilitate low-barrier care and developed a protocol for drug procurement and administration in collaboration with Owen Clinic pharmacists. Our most significant planning obstacles surrounded the decision of where best to operate to maximize reach and avoid duplication of services, and our proposed solution has been to expand our initial geographic focus. In spring 2025, we plan to initiate participant enrollment at Eldorado Community Center (ECC), a methadone clinic which serves over 300 individuals daily at a small shopping center that is five miles east of downtown San Diego. Here, HCV treatment and HIV/STI prevention services are a significant unmet need. Clinical services, including HIV/STI testing and treatment, PrEP initiation, and substance use disorder treatment, will therefore be provided in conjunction with community partners (HRCSD and ECC) on-site via the mobile van. Eventually, we will expand the scope of our mobile program to incorporate low-barrier approaches to care for people living with HIV, who are otherwise unlinked to treatment services."

The study will be performed over 4 years with the implementation of LAI PrEP programs at diverse healthcare settings and pharmacies in Southern California, particularly those serving Black and Latinx MSM and transgender individuals. This community-engaged research will be conducted by an established community-academic partnership between UCSD investigators (Drs. Morris, Montoya, Moore, Turner), Los Angeles LGBT Center (Dr. Bolan) and UCLA (Dr. Holloway). The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework will be used to guide the specific aims, activities, and outcomes of this proposal. This project includes a learning collaborative, which is a group of healthcare professionals from diverse healthcare settings and pharmacies who will come together to foster a collaborative learning environment to explore barriers and facilitators of LAI PrEP implementation.

Injectable cabotegravir (Apretude) is FDA-approved, and other agents, such as lenacapravir, will soon be available. These treatments offer less frequent dosing, which may appeal to individuals who are unable or unwilling to take daily oral medication. However, implementing long-acting injectable PrEP (LAI PrEP) in healthcare settings presents logistical challenges. This project aims to facilitate LAI PrEP uptake in Southern California communities facing structural, geographic, or social barriers to access, with a particular focus on Black and Latinx MSM and transgender individuals.	

In the first year our research team has coalesced to deliver on the proposed research from institutional review board approval, development of research materials and implementation of Aim 1. Each member has clearly defined their role and has actively contributed to the project’s success, ensuring efficient collaboration across community engagement, data collection, and implementation efforts. This structure has been key to maintaining momentum, particularly in addressing the evolving needs of the communities we serve. This has allowed us during this reporting period, to make significant progress, such as successfully recruited members for the Community Advisory Board (CAB) and held quarterly meetings that fostered meaningful discussions. Additionally, we’ve established a learning collaborative group, with monthly meetings designed to assess stakeholders’ readiness and willingness to adopt LAI PrEP.

Challenges included changes in personnel, which temporarily affected project continuity. However, we quickly adapted by recruiting a qualified replacements and redistributing tasks, allowing the project to regain momentum. Another challenge was coordinating with stakeholders who have varying levels of readiness to implement LAI PrEP. We overcame this by leveraging the expertise of our advisory board and adopting a structured approach to engagement.
Moving forward, we plan to expand our engagement with healthcare providers and community leaders to refine strategies for LAI PrEP implementation.

We will evaluate how many women start CAB and how many women continue to receive CAB over one year. We will perform interviews at the end of the study with DHSP and community stakeholders to understand how this program might be expanded and sustained over time and will determine how much the program costs in relation to the outcomes. 

An injection of CAB every eight weeks has been shown to be better for the prevention of HIV through sex than daily pills with a medication taken by mouth called tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC). California is one of five states that account for half of all women living with HIV in the US, and LAC has among the highest number of new infections in CGW within California. Additionally, HIV is very common in TGW in LAC, especially among Black TGW and TGW with substance use disorders. Syphilis is a marker of risk for HIV infection and syphilis is increasing among CGW and TGW in LAC. Almost 25% of new HIV diagnoses in LAC also have syphilis. Therefore, any CGW or TGW without HIV who has been diagnosed with syphilis is an ideal candidate for CAB prevention.

Our proposed demonstration project uses a mobile van so that clients who face challenges in seeking care at health facilities can be reached for health services. Our team includes leaders in public health, academic institutions, and community. The study has been designed to understand how the program can be expanded and continued after the project is over and contribute to shaping how HIV prevention services are delivered in LAC and similar locations in the United States.",

However, the extent to which HIV prevention science has studied how racism is structured – or how racism is brought to life – in relation to HIV-STI transmission is just beginning. This proposed project seeks to study a dimension of structural racism and intersectional oppression that is often ignored – the role of geography, space, and place and how sexual and gender minoritized people of color (SGMPoC) navigate them. This project explores the many ways that queer people of color understand what and how physical, social, and online spaces and places are structured by racism, where we find safety, survival, and community, and what unintended consequences result from constantly navigating a world not built for people like us that perpetuate our vulnerability to HIV-STI transmission. We will center the house and ballroom community (HBC), a community that was formed as an underground sub-culture of SGMPoC in the 1970s in direct response to racism in the LGBT community. Today, the HBC is a motor of queer culture, shaping mainstream media, film, social media, language/slang, identities, and celebrity. The HBC is a social network of SGMPoC who find kinship and belonging in a House, and who come together in community events called Balls to showcase their talent and resilience in fashion, performance, dance, art and realness. We will apply Public Health Critical Race praxis, an anti-racism public health framework, and meaningful engagement through community-based participatory research (CBPR) to center the experiential knowledge of minoritized communities. In fact, the PI of this study is a member and national leader in the HBC; this study is not just community-based, but GROUNDED IN community.",

We seek to understand the nature of both protective and harmful medical mistrust and trust and the positive strategies that Black and Latino sexual minority men (SMM) employ to navigate healthcare systems and to either remain HIV negative or address their HIV diagnosis and achieve viral suppression in the face of intersecting marginalization and racism. Specifically, we will examine how Black and Latino SMM frame their experiences and respond to having or being at risk for a condition that disproportionately affects their racial/ethnic, sexual orientation, and gender groups. What strategies do they employ to overcome negative healthcare perceptions and experiences -- including mistrust, racial discrimination, homophobia, and HIV stigma? Existing measures of positive coping and medical trust and mistrust do not adequately describe important dynamics affecting SMM or their responses to discrimination and mistrust.
Framework: Public Health Critical Race Praxis and Positive Deviance Framework
Approach: Building on our established community partnerships with Bienestar, APLA Health, and four local community advisory boards (CABs), we propose a strengths-based, qualitative, CBPR study to identify and describe coping strategies most relevant to HIV service engagement among racialized populations. We will use existing data from group intervention session audio recordings with Black and Latino SMM to develop and refine measures for positive coping, harmful medical mistrust, and protective and informed medical mistrust and trust.
Aims: The study seeks to (1) qualitatively describe experiences with discrimination, mistrust and trust related to healthcare, and attitudes and strategies that support care engagement in SMM of color using data from over 160 session recordings with approximately 240 intervention group participants; (2) using findings from Aim 1, identify and refine relevant existing items from published coping and medical mistrust and trust scales and draft new items as needed; and (3) elicit feedback through focus group discussions with community experts from established, local CABs to refine and compile a full set of relevant survey items for future cognitive testing.",

Despite the advancement of effective evidence-based biomedical interventions that could end the HIV epidemic and comparatively progressive public health and policy landscapes, HIV inequities persist.

Ending the HIV epidemic in California requires bold leadership and coordinated action to address the root causes of HIV inequities and syndemic interactions of two or more conditions (e.g., HIV and nicotine dependence) and the social context (e.g., resource insecurity, incarceration) in which these conditions develop. Ending the HIV epidemic in California will require innovative, policy and equity-focused strategies that co-address how syndemics and root causes of HIV inequities (i.e., racism, classism, misogyny) increase vulnerability to HIV transmission via intersectional stigma, resource instability, medical distrust, and their sequala on substance use and mental health.

To address this gap, the California Center for HIV Syndemic Policy Research will build capacity within California’s most impacted communities to co-develop and disseminate HIV policy research focused on the social and structural drivers of HIV, substance use, and mental health inequities. This will be done by developing our Center’s infrastructure through four cores focused on HIV policy research (i) Capacity Building, (ii) Methods, and (iii) Dissemination; achieved via coordinated (iv) Administrative support (AIM 1). 

Our Center’s infrastructure will be leveraged to establish Community-Academic Collaborative (CAC; AIM 2) and build up the capacity of community-based organizations addressing HIV syndemic drivers among intersectionally impacted communities across California to (i) co-set the HIV syndemic policy agenda with our Centers’ academic partners and (ii) co-lead equity-focused, rapid response, HIV syndemic policy research, and community-centered engagement and dissemination efforts (AIM 3). Across our multiple capacity-building learning strategies, our Center will invest in the front-line community organizations with lived and living experience to center the needs of communities most impacted by California’s HIV epidemic and bridge existing policy-implementation gaps where HIV inequities persist.","Overview: This capacity-building grant aims to develop a community-academic collaborative (CAC) that centers the development and leadership of HIV syndemic-focused policy research within frontline community organizations underrepresented in California’s HIV response.  

Progress toward completion of stated research aims since funding was approved 08/04/2024 includes: (AIM 1) establishing the processes and procedures, (AIM 2) building relationships with and onboard 4 community organizations to join the CAC, (AIM 3) initiate capacity building activities with CAC members to co-lead at least one rapid HIV policy research project in the next six months, and (4) submit an analysis plan to the California Department of Public Health (CADPH) Office of AIDS (OA) to undertake HIV syndemic-responsive analysis to inform future policy needs for people with HIV in California.

Barriers: Unanticipated challenges were largely tied to communication and collaboration challenges between the funded Co-PIs that reflected efforts to expand the scope of the funded capacity-building work and policy research to place an equal emphasis on tobacco and HIV-related health inequities vs maintaining the focus on tobacco as one of several syndemic drivers of HIV inequities. 

Major accomplishments of the research: Despite these setbacks, we have convened our CAC consisting of frontline representatives from Alameda, Sacramento, Riverside, and San Diego Counties and established a collaborative relationship with the HIV Planning Groups through the OA.  We have led several dissemination activities that aimed to raise awareness of HIV syndemic drivers in communities not equitably benefiting from advances in HIV prevention and treatment We also submitted an analysis plan to the CDPH OA to lead five separate analyses that will shed light on HIV syndemic needs related to violence, housing instability, substance use, tobacco use, and how patient-provider relationship may mediate syndemic exposures on HIV-related outcomes among people with HIV in California. 

Plans for the continuation of research: Through the CAC, we will engage local knowledge leaders in our four EHE counties to collaboratively elicit and prioritize HIV syndemic-focused policy research topics and to co-lead at least one brief HIV policy research protocol."

However, there are currently no approved medications to treat methamphetamine use disorder (MAUD), and existing therapies have demonstrated limited success. This has created a substantial barrier in addressing the HIV epidemic and highlights the need for new approaches toward tackling MAUD. Over the past decade, treatment with ketamine--an FDA-approved medication--has repeatedly been shown to rapidly relieve symptoms of major depression, anxiety, and suicidality in the general population, and studies have suggested promising potential of ketamine therapy in treating other substance use disorders (SUDs), including cocaine, alcohol, and opioid use disorders. Ketamine is thought to work by restoring the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, which may support an individual's ability to learn and adopt new, healthier behaviors. However, access to both ketamine and psychotherapy are limited, particularly for low-income patients and those in the San Francisco Health Network's MediCal program. Moreover, the feasibility and efficacy of ketamine in treating MAUD have not yet been explored. To address this gap, we will conduct a pilot clinical trial of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) with 12 publicly insured patients who engage in HIV risk behaviors and are seeking treatment for MAUD in residential drug treatment programs in San Francisco. The study intervention will consist of 7 behavioral therapy sessions in combination with 3 monitored administrations of intramuscular ketamine delivered by a therapist and medical professional trained in KAP over an approximately 35-day period. While the primary goal will be to evaluate whether this novel, low-cost KAP intervention can be successfully implemented to serve publicly insured patients with MAUD, secondary objectives will include preliminary evaluations of the safety and efficacy of this approach in reducing methamphetamine use and HIV risk behaviors. If feasible, the KAP intervention--intentionally designed using existing community-based resources--can be readily scaled to support interdisciplinary efforts to combat the HIV epidemic across San Francisco and beyond.","Funding from CHRP has allowed for initiation of a single-arm pilot clinical trial of a ketamine-assisted psychotherapy for methamphetamine use disorder and HIV risk behaviors, which is on track to begin recruitment and enrollment by February 2025. Milestones completed over the past year have included (1) writing up and finalizing the clinical trial protocol; (2) seeking feedback on the protocol from a community advisory board, (3) obtaining regulatory approvals from local, state, and federal stakeholders (including the UCSF IRB, the FDA for approval to conduct this study under an Investigational New Drug [IND] application, and the Research Advisory Panel of California [RAPCal] for approval of research focused on treatment of substance use disorders); (4) enacting a subcontract from UCSF to Heluna Health, the non-profit organization that supports research conducted through the San Francisco Department of Public Health's (SFDPH) Center on Substance Use and Health (CSUH); (5) hiring research staff (including a part-time clinical research program manager, a part-time nurse practitioner, and a part-time research assistant) to support in conducting this trial at CSUH; (6) developing a dedicated clinical therapy manual for this study focused on ketamine-assisted motivational enhancement therapy; (7) creating all relevant case report forms (CRFs) and recruitment materials for the study; (8) coordinating plans for necessary laboratory procedures and obtaining study drugs; (9) setting up a dedicated ketamine therapy room at the study site; and (10) identifying 3-4 appropriate study therapists who have experience with ketamine assisted psychotherapy, trauma-informed care, and working with the population of interest. The biggest barrier has been an issue with the subcontract that has delayed the hiring of our study therapists. This clerical issue is now being actively addressed but has resulted in a delay in initiating recruitment for this trial by 1-2 months. Once therapists are fully on-boarded (goal: by mid-February 2025), we will initiate recruitment and proceed with data collection. The study has already garnered significant interest among potential participants, and we are working on an initial protocol paper detailing the novel aspects of this study, to be submitted by mid-2025."

Many TGNB people in this region face high rates of housing insecurity, homelessness, and poverty, which lead to higher HIV rates and related health problems. Poverty makes it harder for people to stay engaged in HIV care and maintain a low viral load or viral suppression. Some TGNB individuals turn to criminalized sex work, which also increases their risk of violence and poor HIV outcomes. Our preliminary research in LAC shows that TGNB people face significant barriers to HIV care, such as transportation difficulties, unstable employment and housing, undocumented immigration status, and stigma in workplaces and healthcare settings. This highlights an urgent need for innovative solutions that support HIV care and address related challenges among TGNB populations in LAC. We propose a new program called ""Trans Wealth,"" developed through a 7-year partnership between the Los Angeles LGBT Center’s Trans Wellness Center (TWC) and local researchers. Trans Wealth will provide 30 TGNB individuals living with HIV, who are experiencing financial hardship and/or homelessness, with either a guaranteed monthly income of $1,000 for six months or a one time lump sum payment of $6000. In addition to the financial support, participants will simultaneously receive financial literacy counseling from TWC’s Transgender Economic Empowerment Program. This program will offer guidance on setting goals, financial literacy, educational and employment planning, and legal services. Guaranteed income programs have shown positive results in improving health and financial stability. Trans Wealth will be guided by community-engaged research methods to ensure effective development and delivery. We will measure the success of the program by collecting health data (like viral load and immune cell count) and assessing mental health, financial stability, employment readiness, quality of life, and exposure to violence at baseline, 2, 4 and 6-month follow up visits. We will also seek feedback from participants, staff, and community advisory board members on how acceptable, appropriate, safe, and feasible the Trans Wealth program is.",

Current state-level data demonstrates there have also been substantial increases in both opioid overdose deaths and HIV diagnoses among people who use drugs. Further, Orange County, California has been identified as an Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) priority jurisdiction due to the high prevalence of HIV diagnoses in the region. Exacerbating this documented need for HIV and overdose prevention efforts in the county, people who use drugs have numerous barriers to accessing healthcare including stigma, homelessness, and transportation challenges. Further, Orange County’s political climate has been hostile towards state-approved, evidence-based HIV prevention and harm reduction strategies for people who use drugs (e.g., syringe service programs). As such, there is a critical need for novel HIV prevention and harm reduction efforts to improve health outcomes for people who use drugs in this region. In response, the proposed research project seeks to explore the feasibility and acceptability of harm reduction vending machines (HVRMs) among people who use drugs and relevant service providers, law enforcement, and community members in Orange County, California. HVRMs are innovative, low-barrier technology-based options that expand access to supplies and engage harder to reach populations by dispensing HIV and harm reduction materials such as syringes, naloxone, fentanyl test strips, condoms, and HIV, hepatitis C, and STI self-test kits. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), the proposed research will engage in qualitative research methods to assess the perceived barriers and facilitators to HVRM adoption and implementation, potential HVRM locations, and desired materials for inclusion in HVRMs via in-depth interventions with approximately 20-30 people who use drugs (Aim 1) and via key informant interviews with approximately 20-30 staff, clinicians, and health care professionals serving people who use drugs, law enforcement, and community members (Aim 2) in Orange County.

Individuals who report injection drug use as their HIV transmission risk factor have the lowest rates of viral suppression of all demographic groups in San Diego. Further, individuals with HIV who use methamphetamine in San Diego have lower retention in care and HIV viral suppression rates compared to individuals with HIV who do not use methamphetamine. Traditional HIV care models that require patients to secure transportation, schedule appointments, and navigate burdensome administrative processes are especially challenging for people who use drugs. Novel implementation strategies, including low barrier mobile approaches to HIV primary care and technology that transcend traditional care models, are necessary to better engage this population in HIV primary care. The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Owen Clinic which is the largest and most comprehensive HIV Medicine Clinic in San Diego aims to establish and evaluate low barrier mobile technology and HIV primary care services in close collaboration with the County of San Diego Harm Reduction Program. We propose parking a UCSD mobile unit adjacent to the newly established County of San Diego mobile syringe service program unit with the goal of meeting people who use drugs where they are at. This project will support the establishment of key infrastructure (telehealth, electronic storage lockers with key pads for participant medication and substance use equipment storage, and vein finding equipment for phlebotomy in people who inject drugs) trained personnel, and data recording systems to enable the implementation and evaluation of low barrier mobile technology and HIV primary care to address the ongoing HIV public health crisis and work toward ending the HIV epidemic in San Diego.

Spatial approaches to improving health of minoritized populations is critical since geographic access can pose significant barriers to uptake of interventions. Given the vast geography of the LA county region, it is imperative to better understand how different technologies will work in differing areas so that relevant needs are addressed adequately. Preliminary research by the PI has identified unique geo-spatial patterns that suggest different low barrier technologies will be relevant in different areas based on social behaviors (e.g., where people living with HV experiencing homelessness sleep, where SMM engage in sexual encounters, and where SMM engage in substance use, etc.). Effective low-barrier HIV prevention and care must be delivered in the right place and at the right time. 

Low barrier technologies for HIV prevention and care are especially important for people who are insecurity housed. Sexual minority populations experience housing insecurity at rates higher than heterosexual populations, especially SMM of color. Housing insecurity is predictive of poor self-rated health among SMM, poor mental health, and poor HIV-related outcomes. The mechanisms that link housing insecurity to poor HIV outcomes include delayed, reduced or postponed health care or medications, higher rates of mental health disorders, substance use, and poor adherence to HIV treatment. However, geographically responsive HIV treatment and care services, including mobile HIV testing vans or street-based PrEP outreach that meets people where they need services, can improve HIV-related outcomes.",

Accurately identifying people who are out of care or who are at risk of falling out of care is vital so that public health workers can allocate resources and preventive services to those that need it most.

Currently, public health services use routinely collected HIV data such as viral load or other blood tests to identify PWH who have not accessed HIV care in more than a year. Outreach personnel then try to contact these people and help them find where to get care. This is known as 'data-to-care'. However, reports would suggest that this strategy is inefficient as many PWH identified using data-to-care have in fact moved out of the area, are in care elsewhere, or are uncontactable. In addition, there is a substantial delay to outreach as a person must be without labs for more than 1 year to be eligible.

Machine learning (ML) is a tool whereby researchers use new statistical techniques to study patterns in data that can sometimes predict outcomes. For instance, irregular viral load testing might be suggestive of a person who is only partially engaged with care. We propose to use machine learning techniques on HIV data reported routinely to the San Diego Public Health Department to see if it can improve the identification of PWH who are out of care or at risk of falling out of care. We will compare which ML techniques provide the best results and which patterns of data provide the most information. Once we have selected the best ML techniques and data selection, we will compare the ML techniques to the existing data-to-care program to gauge if the ML can be more efficient in selecting which PWH would benefit from additional resources. Preliminary results performed by our group indicated that about half of PWH identified using ML will be out of care or not on treatment in the next year which would be a substantial improvement on current data-to-care activities. 

By using ML, we hope to improve public health activities and make them more efficient so that PWH who are struggling with attending clinic or adhering to therapy can receive the help they need sooner.",

From 2017 to 2021, AI/AN experienced a 16% increase in new HIV diagnosis while it remained stable or decreased for most other racial/ethnic groups in the United States. About 20% of AI/AN living with HIV are unaware of their infection status, compared to 13% of the general U.S. population. Additionally, AI/AN face higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, suggesting a heightened risk for HIV.

To address these disparities, our academic team partnered with a Southern California Tribe to explore the integration of HIV self-testing within a Tribal Wellness program. We found a preference for home-based testing over clinic-based options, with nearly half of survey participants expressing interest in obtaining self-test kits through the Tribal Wellness program.  Building on this successful collaboration, we initiated a new project to evaluate an overdose prevention vending machine (ODPVM) that dispenses free naloxone. In its first year, the ODPVM was used over 100 times, demonstrating strong community engagement. We aim to expand upon this work by introducing a smart vending machine that provides low-barrier access to HIV testing and other harm reduction resources and services. 

Using a community-based participatory research approach, we will conduct a formative evaluation with the following aims:
1.	Assess the feasibility and appropriateness of delivering HIV self-testing kits and prevention resources through a vending machine.
2.	Identify facilitators and barriers to implementing a smart vending machine on American Indian tribal lands.
3.	Develop partnerships for delivering HIV prevention and harm reduction services via a smart vending machine.

This work has the potential to be of high impact by generating actionably findings that can inform innovative efforts to diagnose HIV early and connect individuals to care and resources through low-barrier technology. By focusing on a Southern California Tribe, this study supports the HIV National Strategic Plan to reduce disparities among high-risk populations, offering valuable insights for broader applications in Indian Country.",

These findings suggest that current strategies for ending the epidemic, including the use of low-barrier technologies for prevention and treatment, are not reaching unhoused individuals at the same rate they reach those with stable housing. Unhoused individuals face daily challenges to meeting basic needs that make HIV prevention and treatment a last priority. Continual displacement of unsheltered homeless people further disrupts their ability to access care: encampment sweeps lead to the loss of belongings and create literal and relational distance between healthcare providers and clients, both of which can disrupt access to HIV interventions. 
Safe sleeping, or sanctioned encampment, sites may minimize the disruption in access to HIV technologies. Such sites provide individuals with a place to sleep without fear of being ticketed, pushed out, or arrested. Safe sleeping sites are low-barrier, meaning that individuals do not need identification to enter and do not need to adhere to sobriety rules (although they cannot use substances on-site). Clients are able to access a range of services, including showers, laundry, food, and medical care. Because safe sleeping provides individuals with a settled location, they may be an important site for mobile health services and the implementation of low barrier technology HIV interventions, including the use of medication adherence phone apps, vending machines for HIV testing kits, or safe boxes for storing belongings.  
This study will take place in the City of San Diego. San Diego is one of 50 jurisdictions that account for more than half of all new HIV diagnoses in the U.S.. High transmission rates in the city may in part be connected to the high volume of people experiencing homelessness. San Diego opened two safe sleeping sites in October, 2023 after the city policymakers banned homeless encampments in public places.

However, drug resistance, including to the latest generation ART, is becoming a more pervasive clinical problem. Because resistant viruses typically replicate less efficiently than non-resistant viruses, whether a drug resistant mutation (DRM) persists in the viral population depends on the intricate tradeoff between resistance and fitness. Here, we note one important and novel consideration. The occurrence and effect of DRMs in response to ART are strongly dependent on the specific genetic sequence background in which the mutation occurs. Previously, we showed that the fitness effect of primary DRMs can vary widely within and between patient populations due to epistatic interactions of the DRM with the sequence background of the virus. Accordingly, laboratory-derived molecular HIV clones, such as NL4-3, HxB2, or LAI IIIB, often fail to accurately reflect the complex genetic backgrounds of patient-derived viral sequences. Unfortunately, current methods for evaluating fitness effects of patient-derived DRMs rely on these same laboratory-derived molecular viral clones. To address this discrepancy, we propose to develop a novel machine-learning-based lightweight and ready-to-use software to predict the differential effects of DRMs premised on individual patient sequence backgrounds. The proposed software will leverage comprehensive HIV sequence data from patients in the Stanford and Los Alamos HIV databases to predict the fitness effects of DRMs in various patient-derived sequences. We aim to provide an accurate, easy-to-use, and reliable tool that can be developed as an application for clinicians for the potential assessment of drug resistance in patients, thus facilitating the development of tailored treatment strategies, including but not limited to the prescription of better combination regimens. This tool would represent a significant advance in bridging the gap between laboratory-based predictions and real-world patient scenarios. Its implementation could make costly DRM testing alternatives available to underserved communities, optimize treatment efficacy in diverse patient populations, and yield more effective personalized treatment strategies for HIV.",

Lamellar membranes based on homogeneous 2D-materials have demonstrated intriguing performance for water treatment, but suffered from poor selectivity, membrane swelling, stacking defects, or poor stability. To address these problems, I propose to develop heterogenous lamellar membranes by combining Graphene Oxide (GO) with porous nanosheets such as Zeolite and MoS2. Heterogenous stacking of GO-Zeolite/MoS2 nanosheets can minimize membrane swelling by rebalancing the attractive and repulsive forces between layers, thus improving stability of the interlamellar spacing and membrane selectivity. In-plane pores on porous nanosheets and the interlamellar nanochannels provide hybrid transport pathways for molecules, which could be exploited to transcend the permeability-selectivity tradeoff of conventional membrane materials. Together with swelling control, a major goal of my study is to understand the hybrid transport mechanisms in the heterogeneous membranes to achieve high separation performance. I propose to incorporate 2D nanosheets onto a single-nanopore substrate and investigate ion transport using patch clamp technique. This analysis will isolate the molecular transport through in-plane pores and nanochannels by altering substrate pore size and thickness of deposited nanosheets. Molecular transport will be likely dominated by in-plane pores when the substrate pore is small, while transport through nanochannels will be more pronounced with larger substrate pore and thicker nanosheets deposition. TEM-compatible, single-pore silicon nitride membrane will be used as membrane substrate to facilitate device imaging and characterization. This work will leverage the LLNL mentor expertise in nanofluidics and ion/water transport, as well access to LLNL tools for single nanosheet (Axopatch patch clamp and Keithley instruments) and centimeter-scale membrane transport (RO and diffusion cells) characterization. With combined structural and chemical control in 2D membranes and selective characterization of the transport pathways, this research will ultimately provide fundamental knowledge required to develop lamellar membranes meeting the demanding performance metrics for efficient water purification and desalination.","In this project, we aim to use two-dimensional (2D) material to construct layer-stacked membranes with well-defined nanochannels for water treatment. We proposed to develop heterogenous membranes made from combining molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with graphene oxide (GO)-based nanosheets, which has not yet been well studied. Our first objective is to synthesis heterogenous MoS2-GO (MG) membranes at different MoS2 to GO ratio through vacuum filtration technique and examine the membrane stability, internal stacking structure, and filtration performance. Our second objective is to synthesis positively charged graphene oxide nanosheets (PrGO) for it to be electrostatically assembled with MoS2 through layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. The physicochemical properties and filtration performance of this MoS2-PrGO membranes is compared with LbL membranes traditionally made with polymeric polyelectrolyte. Our final task is to investigate the transport of molecules through the 2D membranes as a foundation for future fine tuning of membrane performances. We successfully completed the first and second objective and have two publications prepared from each. We discovered that the MoS2-GO stacking structure plays a key role in improving membrane performances. Comparing to homogenous GO and MoS2 membranes, swelling and restacking of MG membranes was reduced, especially when the material ratio of MoS2 is ~40%. The filtration performances were also found to be the best comparing to other ratios and homogenous membranes. We also developed PrGO that carries a strong positive charge and assembled it with the negatively charged MoS2 though LbL technique. Compared to traditional MoS2-polyelectrolyte membranes, this membrane that almost made entirely by nanosheets have a better stacking structure that leads to better filtration performance. For our final task, we developed electrochemical approach to study the diffusion of ions through the membranes. By applying a range of potential and analyzing the current, we compared the mobility of cations and anions through the PrGO membranes. However, the repeatability of our experimental result was very low. We found the selection of electrode and the experimental conditions can greatly alter the results. Though we reached the end of project, we plan to improve the experiment design to accurately determine the ions mobility in the future"

Despite intense efforts, the formation, transport, and spin polarization mechanisms of these excitons are not well understood. My dissertation is focused on understanding exciton behavior in halide perovskites through a wide variety of transport and spectroscopic experimentation coupled to theoretical simulations. Recently, we developed unique fabrication procedures that allow for the novel study of exciton transport under a wide range of temperature and charge density conditions in single crystalline perovskites. We also revealed indirect signatures of excitonic dominance over charge diffusion in perovskites up to technologically relevant temperatures. This Fellowship will allow me to leverage these breakthroughs and visualize exciton dynamics under several key experimental avenues - space, time, spectrum, and dimensionality (3D bulk to 2D molecular layers), with an aim of understanding and manipulating excitonic responses. Through a combination of spatially, temporally, and spectrally resolved temperature-dependent fluorescence and absorption microscopies, we will reveal an increasing excitonic population at low temperatures and provide direct evidence of its connection to enhanced photoinduced carrier diffusion behavior. Furthermore, we will utilize LANL’s ultrafast optical microscopy facilities to study the formation and recombination dynamics of the excitons in 2D and 3D samples, thus validating dimensionality as an important tuning parameter for their photovoltaic response. Overall, this work will provide better understanding of the interplay among free carriers, excitons, phonons, and spins and allow us to harness these interactions for creating new materials with enhanced optoelectronic and spintronic properties. Working under joint supervision from Dr. Yarotski (LANL) and Prof. Yu (UCD) will allow me to benefit from their expertise of photovoltaic materials, as well as nanoscale and ultrafast optical and transport techniques. The results of this work will lead to many high-profile publications that will be of great interest to a broad community of researchers in condensed matter physics, optical science, and related fields.","This project aimed to study the formation and recombination dynamics of excitons in both 2D and 3D samples of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), through a variety of measurement techniques, in pursuit of manipulating the excitonic effects toward creating more efficient and stable solar energy devices. I will go ahead and state outright that things did not go according to plan. Thankfully, however, much progress was still made, and the project will continue, to a degree, with the acceptance of a postdoc position that resulted directly from this fellowship. In terms of research aims, things get somewhat complicated. While we did successfully observe exciton signatures in our photoluminescence and photocurrent spectroscopy measurements of HOIP samples, we have thus far been unable to accurately track the 'movement' of these excitons in time. It remains unclear if these results are incorrect and there is something at fault with the experiment, or if the results are correct and our understanding of exciton recombination behavior in these samples needs to be adjusted. As for the scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) measurements of 2D HOIPs, there was initial success in the creation of functioning micro-flake devices to be studied. Unfortunately, as was mentioned in the 1-year report, a confusing scenario among some of our LANL collaborators led to the publication of a study that was extremely similar to our on-going work. My previous work was cited in this publication, but this situation effectively led to us cancelling that aspect of our project, for the time being. Now, on to the better news - Between COVID delays, awkward competing laboratory situations, extended power outages due to required oxygen monitor maintenance, and a literal fire raging toward the town, some major accomplishments were still achieved. Two first-author publications, one of which is on a 1D HOIP-related material (this work being a replacement for the 2D work), and (potentially) four co-authored studies were created. One of these co-authorships is already published, two are in preparation, and the fourth is about to be submitted to Nature. Finally, the construction of the Time-Resolved Experimental (T-REx) microscope, combined with my fun hair colors, appears to have earned me the next step in my career - a postdoc position with the Center for Integrated Nano-Technology."

However, this is not the only blueprint for achieving rigidity, high strength, and abrasion resistance in composites. The Humboldt squid and several carnivorous marine worms have ""biotools"" (beaks, jaws or teeth) that exhibit impressive mechanical performance yet contain little or no inorganic mineral content. The bloodworm Glycera dibranchiata offers an interesting example, as its load- and impact-resistant jaws are comprised of a network of proteins, mostly unmineralized copper and melanin. The use of melanin as a structural component is a unique design concept not found elsewhere, as the typical biological roles of melanin are pigmentation and photoprotection. Limited prior studies of Glycera jaws revealed hard, strong, and tough mechanical properties- on par with or even exceeding human bone- despite minimal degree of mineralization (<1%). However, the formation of these biocomposites, the exact role of melanin, and the synergy among the various components in the Glycera jaw remain poorly understood. The principal objectives of this research are to elucidate the structure-property relationships of melanin, proteins, and metal building blocks in the jaw and to use this information to inform the design of future lightweight high-performance composites. To unravel this mystery, we will investigate the jaws' molecular and nanoscale mechanics, the morphology and structure of melanin, and the interactions among individual constituents in Glycera jaws by leveraging state-of-the-art 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) and single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS). In addition, since melanin is known for its extraordinary radioactive shielding properties in organisms exposed to high background radiation levels, we will investigate whether these biocomposites exhibit any radioprotective capabilities. New information regarding the relationship between biochemical structure and mechanical behavior of the various components will be coupled with bioinspired materials processing and the unique capabilities of LLNL on advanced manufacturing processes as well as materials characterization to support the fabrication of biomimetic lightweight yet strong melanin composites, with potential applications as structural and radiation shielding materials.","The venomous jaw of the marine worm Glycera dibranchiate is a natural composite biomaterial that exhibits exceptional strength, toughness, and wear resistance - mechanical properties that are hard to achieve in concert.  The millimeter-sized beak is comprised of four component materials:  melanin in the form of eumelanin, a protein called Glycera multitask protein (GMTP), ionic copper, and mineralized copper (Cu2(OH)3Cl) of the atacamite form.  The large amount of copper metal is highly unusual in that copper is toxic in many living organisms;  the Glycera worm is the only known organism to contain (Cu2(OH)3Cl) as a mineral.  While melanin is common in living organisms as a pigment or photoprotectant, in the Glycera jaw it is used as a structural component. Again, Glycera dibranchiate is the only known system to use melanin for its structural properties. This report investigates these two unusual components in an effort to better understand their role in the mechanical properties of the natural composite.  In this study unusual crack development under high impact testing of the jaw suggested material ductility; the crack signature was retained when only the melanin was present suggesting that the melanin was largely responsible for the toughness of the jaw.  Using atomic force microscopy techniques, specifically single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) we tested the interactions of the GMTP and melanin and established that the cumulative effect of noncovalent interactions provides intermediate-strength sacrificial bonds that can be ruptured to dissipate energy and imbue the interface with molecular toughness.   The presences of covalent bonds, even at a low frequency, ensure that the interface can withstand large forces before ultimate rupture. The mineralized copper in the form of atacamite fibers was imaged with transmission electron microscopy across several length scales revealing the macroscopic arrangement of atacamite fibers, the segmented nature of the fibers, which is believed to provide ductility, and the presence of aligned atacamite grains within each segment. The results obtained so far, support the completion of all aims of the original proposal the novel findings from the research are being finalized and incorporated into a manuscript which will be submitted soon ."

Much of this increase in atmospheric CH4 has been attributed to greater inter-annual and seasonal variability in climate and water table in tropical wetlands. Tropical ecosystems are projected to undergo large changes in precipitation, which may lead to even larger changes in atmospheric CH4. There are significant gaps in global carbon budgets and climate predictions due to the lack of carbon cycling data from tropical wetlands. Filling in these gaps will help better predict how the large carbon stocks in these soils will respond to future environmental change. The goal of this proposed work will be to assess the environmental controls on methanogenesis and methanotrophy in deep soil profiles across tropical wetland ecosystems where 104 Gt of global carbon is stored. Specifically, we will examine surface and soil profile flux to accurately predict changes in future CH4 efflux. This will be the first assessment of CH4 dynamics in tropical wetlands below 1m, where the majority of CH4 is produced. This project will measure radiocarbon using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) to determine source of CH4 from tropical wetlands. The PhD student, Alexandra Hedgpeth, has previously worked at LLNL’s Center for AMS and is proficient in sample preparation and graphitization. As such, training will focus on AMS runs, and modeling and interpretation of data under the mentorship of Dr. Karis McFarlane. There is a significant lack of CH4 flux data and a large sampling bias towards Indonesia and Malaysia due to the difficulties associated with field work in these regions. We will conduct the proposed research in a Panamanian wetland site previously established by Alexandra Hedgpeth to add needed data from other tropical wetland regions to provide a more extensive understanding in the spatial pattern of CH4 flux. We hypothesize that the results of this study will demonstrate that in tropical wetlands rapid drops in water table lead to short-lived but large CH4 release from anaerobic subsoils to the atmosphere. We expect that decreased moisture and water table together suppress methanotrophy increasing CH4 efflux.","Funding from this grant supported the lab work that identified that young carbon delivered from the surface of the peat soil was responsible for regulating soil respiration deep in the peatland soils. This demonstrated the importance of vertical transport of surface material suspended in the pore water down the peat column. If this method of transport were to be interrupted, for example when a peatland is drained, older carbon might become a new source material for soil respiration.
This project is aimed at exploring the carbon dynamics of a peatland in Panama. By using isotopes, we can tease apart what’s processes are influencing carbon cycling below the soil surface in tropical peatlands. Samples collected from the Panamanian peatland were analyzed and measured to determine what is the source of respired carbon from deep in the soil, and what metabolic pathway controls methane release from the peatland. This work will help the scientific community better understand how carbon moves throughout these carbon rich soils and better predict how these carbon stocks might influence global carbon-climate dynamics.
All field work and lab analysis for this research has been completed, with the recent addition of carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy or 13C NMR, completed at the end of the 2023 spring quarter. The complete data set for this project includes, radiocarbon and stable isotopes for the dissolved organic carbon, bulk carbon, and respiration products from a neotropical peatland. Included in the descriptive characterization of the peatland is the 13C NMR of the bulk soil, used to characterize the organic compounds present in the peat, and the % carbon and nitrogen of the bulk peat. This will give a clearer understanding of what compounds are being utilized by microbes as well as those compounds remaining within the peat after thousands of years. We can use this dataset to test the hypothesis that easily decomposable material from the surface of the soil, more readily bioavailable compounds, are the main fuel for microbial decomposition – and therefore the main source of carbon being released as greenhouse gas.
Due to the travel restrictions associated with the ongoing pandemic a second field work expedition was not possible. However, we can overcome this barrier by maximizing the information we can gain from the samples collected from the initial field season. These samples have been analyzed for stable and radiocarbon isotopes, elemental composition of carbon and nitrogen, water content, and soon will be analyzed for compound specific carbon content. All of which can greatly answer the research questions posed by this work: how does carbon cycle within tropical peat soils, and how might this change with a changing climate? This work was presented as a scientific talk at the American Geophysical Union conference in December of 2022 and the CPEAT meeting in 2023. These were great venues to showcase this tropical peatland work and prepare the scientific community for the first publication."

These alloys can exhibit desirable combinations of properties, such as strength, toughness and corrosion resistance, which make them attractive for a range of potential applications in energy, transportation and national security sectors. Due to their composition, and the disordered nature of their atomic structure, these alloys display a statistical distribution of local atomic environments that underlie their ability to host a variety of different deformation mechanisms, and that can affect diffusive transport at high temperatures or under irradiation.  An important issue for their design then becomes the exact nature of these statistical distributions, i.e., whether they are characteristic of perfectly random compositional disorder, or possess differing degrees of local atomic short-range order (SRO). Understanding the kinetic processes that govern the formation and destruction of SRO is necessary for optimizing properties in the processing of CCAs, as well as controlling their performance in extreme conditions. The proposed scope of this research is to use advanced atomistic computer simulations to investigate these questions surrounding the kinetics of SRO formation and its effect on diffusive transport of relevant point defects. A major limitation with current computer simulation methods at the relevant atomistic length scales is reaching diffusive timescales without simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy and general applicability. Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) scientists have pioneered the development of a suite of tools to overcome this limitation, called Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (AMD). Working with LANL scientists, AMD methods will be applied to simulate the kinetics of SRO formation, and to understand its impact on point defect diffusion.  The work will focus initially on a concentrated Ni-Cr alloy, a material central to LANL’s Fundamental Understanding of Transport Under Reactor Extremes (FUTURE) project. Results obtained spanning simulation parameters of temperature, solute, and defect concentration will allow for the development and validation of theoretical models that can predict transport kinetics in systems with SRO, thus opening this analysis to CCA materials more broadly.","This project focuses on understanding the effect of short-range ordering (SRO, where unlike species have a higher probability of being near each other compared to the random case) and short-range clustering (SRC, where like species have a higher probability of being near each other compared to the random case) on mass transport, as well as understanding the formation kinetics of SRO/SRC in a binary metallic alloy. Using our previously created atomistic computer simulation which can describe mass transport as well as the kinetics of SRO/SRC formation, we have been able to validate a coarse-grained model which can provide reasonable estimates for the relaxation time of SRO/SRC formation. The coarse-grained model is analytical and requires much simpler parameterization than the fully atomistic simulation. We anticipate this model to be useful for experimental design of processing conditions meant to either promote or suppress SRO/SRC, as alternative fully atomistic approaches are much more computationally expensive and may not provide reliable estimates. While the main focus was originally on binary alloys, preliminary results of the coarse-grained model as extended to a multicomponent system seem to be encouraging, increasing the potential utility of this model to disordered solid solution alloys with an arbitrary number of components. Additionally, we have found that the presence of SRO/SRC can either increase or decrease mass transport. Such a finding challenges the current prevailing belief that SRO/SRC should always lead to slower diffusivities. We find that this effect is largely dependent on the concentration of the alloy, suggesting an overlooked contribution of the effect of SRO/SRC on the connectivity of atom types in an alloy, as well as the nature of the connectivity. We believe that this finding opens up new questions and research directions for understanding mass transport in concentrated solid solution alloys."

Kesavan,spkesavan@ucdavis.edu,"University of California, Davis",,National Lab Graduate Fellow,,"With the end of Moore’s law in sight, High-Performance Computing (HPC) has increasingly focused on heterogeneous architectures to meet the exascale computing goals. Leading supercomputers provide unprecedented capabilities through a combined prowess of large multi-core CPUs and several high-performant GPUs on each computational node. While heterogeneous architectures have demonstrated effectiveness in solving large and complex scientific problems, there still exist many opportunities to improve the returns on investments in this relatively new paradigm.

In particular, although significant speedup can be reaped by porting the computationally expensive operations to the GPUs or by using dedicated I/O nodes, the corresponding data movement costs may substantially compensate for the overall gains. Identification of such data movement penalties, in particular, to and from I/O nodes, between CPUs and GPUs, and across memory hierarchies, can shed new light on the associated bottlenecks, leading to development of new ways to improve the utilization of these architectures.

We propose to develop new visual analysis techniques to enable a detailed investigation of data movement costs and investigate their impact on the application’s performance. We will develop a new framework to allow holistic exploration of data movement to satiate the need for large-scale heterogeneous computing. Focusing on the need for in-situ exploration, e.g., for understanding the data costs of training deep neural networks, we will visualize streaming performance data enabling real-time exploration for applications on heterogeneous machines.

Although one may use known metrics to analyze the performance of applications, such an approach is primarily useful for validating/invalidating their hypothesis. Whereas developing new conjectures about the causes and potential solutions to performance problems is typically not possible. Our framework will inform code developers, computational scientists, and HPC researchers of possible ways to improve machine utilization and efficiently run larger and communication-demanding applications, e.g., by identifying incompatible job placement, and hardware latencies and communication patterns. Overall, our approach can help in narrowing the growing gap between the computing power of processes and data bandwidth at various levels of granularities.","With the end of Moore's law and the increased flexibility of hardware accelerators (e.g., Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)), the future of computing is rapidly transitioning towards the use of heterogeneous architectures. Today, heterogeneous computing is adopted extensively to push the frontiers of computational science in both the scale and complexity of problems. Large-scale supercomputers (161 of the current Top 500) increasingly rely on collaborative execution models, where computation is largely offloaded to accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs), whereas the CPUs manage non-portable computations, network communication, and workload distribution. Although heterogeneous architectures provide unprecedented capabilities to solve large and complex scientific problems, they introduce new challenges in effective utilization of the available computing resources.To this end, we present Data Movement Visualized (DMV) — a framework to track data movement across heterogeneous interfaces and understand their implication on performance trade-offs.

In the first year, we developed DMTracker – an unified data collection interface (built using Python) to facilitate performance collection for tracking data movement across CPU–GPU and GPU–GPU interfaces.. DMTracker enabled code-based instrumentation to track data movement across the HAC domains. DMTracker unifies the performance data across several state-of-the-art tools. Catering specifically to data movement, this year, we design DMVis to enable interactive performance analysis across the HAC domains. DMVis uses linked views to provide a holistic exploration and analysis, leading to potential optimizations and improved applications’ memory usage. DMV has been developed in close collaboration with domain experts by collecting requirements and designing a tool to fit the analysis workflow. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMV framework by investigating the GEMM kernel under different memory allocation strategies and the training of the GPT-2 model. We identify performance optimizations through careful data management and reduce overall runtime. Finally, we conduct an overhead analysis to evaluate the DMTracker interface. Overall, we have developed an unified interface with reduced overhead (by at least 20%) to summarize data movement."

Scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) are heavily invested in understanding these materials’ behavior in the field. It is known that under extreme thermal and irradiation conditions, metallic nuclear components display unique material response. Traditional theory dictates that metals weaken under elevated temperatures, due to the increased mobilization of microscopic defects, such as dislocations. However, experimental observations show a clear temperature insensitive regime, and only at a critical temperature does the stress expectedly decrease. Furthermore, irradiation of metals and alloys induces the formation of additional defects. Thus, exposure to radiation affects the critical temperature, but the coupled effect of radiation and temperature is not fully understood. Specifically, dislocation motion and interactions with irradiation defects are operative at microscopic length scales and high speeds, making them difficult to observe experimentally. Additionally, conventional materials characterization techniques are often insufficient to function in extreme environments properly and safely. Thus, understanding dislocation-defect interactions in nuclear materials requires predictive, multi-physics, three-dimensional simulation capabilities. My project aims to study these interactions in face-centered cubic metals, such as stainless steel, using the phase-field dislocation dynamics (PFDD) model. Collaboration with LANL is critical to this work, as the PFDD code originated there and the lab is home to scientists who continue to develop it. PFDD operates on a scale in which individual dislocations, defects, and their interactions can be modeled. We plan to study thermal effects on mechanical response due to dislocation/irradiation defect interactions by modeling temperature via a combined PFDD-kinetic Monte Carlo framework. At the critical temperature, we hypothesize that changes in dislocation behavior in the presence of irradiation-induced defects affects material softening; thus, irradiation rate plays a role in determining the critical temperature. Insights from this work will assist LANL scientists in designing improved radiation-resistant materials for nuclear energy applications.","Metals and alloys in nuclear systems are subject to a combination of high temperature and irradiation, forming microstructural defects that impede dislocation motion and increase mechanical strength. However, there are still many unknowns regarding how defects interact with dislocations, and the impact of these reactions on bulk mechanical properties. In this project, we use Phase Field Dislocation Dynamics (PFDD), a multi-physics and open-source modelling tool developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), to simulate dislocation interactions with irradiation-induced defects with the goal of uncovering microstructural dynamics and connecting them to macroscale outcomes in engineering metals. This year’s work focused on advancing the PFDD model to study cross slip, a fundamental method by which dislocations bypass defects. Our research specifically focuses on how the complex dislocation structure of face-centered cubic (FCC) metals, such as stainless steel, along with other material properties affects cross slip behavior. Thus far, we have demonstrated the ability for PFDD to simulate cross slip of dislocations in eight FCC metals, and identified trends between fundamental material properties and critical stress to cross slip. Our findings have not been observed in prior PFDD studies and are a useful source of information to materials designers engineering high-strength alloys. Computational resources at Los Alamos have been an essential resource for running the PFDD simulations making up the bulk of this work. Additionally, our project benefits greatly from collaborations with LANL scientists on the PFDD team. A publication on our research has been submitted for review to a major journal in the field of computational materials science.

The effect of temperature on cross slip in FCC metals is an important aspect of dislocation behavior that we have yet to consider. Thus, we are currently extending the PFDD model to simulate thermally activated cross slip via a coupled phase field-kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. We also plan to apply a complete and robust model of dislocation bypass mechanisms, including cross slip, to study dislocation interactions with microstructural obstacles such as irradiation-induced defects and precipitates in advanced engineering materials."

soil. It is known that after a dry season, a precipitation event can cause a jolt of activity reawakening soil
communities. Recent studies from UC Davis and LLNL have shown that the number of viral species in
grassland soils is related to soil moisture. In other systems, phosphorus concentrations can affect the
number of virus particles produced during infection. Current approaches to study viral communities only
target specific types of viruses, and the viral signal is heavily occluded by microbial DNA and extracellular DNA
that persists in soils — leaving us without the ability to observe how actively infecting viruses may
contribute to microbial and viral community assembly and terrestrial nutrient cycles, such as the carbon
cycle. Leveraging recent advances in DNA sequencing a first-of-its-type study observing the complete
lifecycle of viruses in grassland soils after a simulated precipitation was performed at LLNL. This was
achieved by creating microcosms with dry grassland soils, simulating a precipitation event by adding
natural abundance water or oxygen-heavy water, then adding potassium phosphate to half of the
microcosms, and sampling the microcosms weekly for three weeks. The DNA were extracted
from these microcosms to capture all virus types and density fractions were separated (based on heavy

isotope probing pipeline pioneered at LLNL. Additionally, extracellular DNA and viral particle DNA were
extracted from collected soils. This amount of sequencing generated an enormous dataset of viral and
microbial genetic data creating an opportunity to leverage the supercomputer and bioinformatic
expertise found at LLNL to process the data. From these data, we will track the production and
persistence of viruses as they cycle from actively killing their hosts and producing virus particles or
remain as integrated viruses in their host capable of metabolic rewiring. These data will give us further
insight into the impact of viral communities on soil microbiome structuring and a better understanding
of how viruses respond to environmental changes and how virus-host dynamics could impact the carbon
cycle and other terrestrial nutrient cycles.","The UC National Laboratory Fees Research Program (LFRP) Fellowship has allowed me to develop and learn new skills while at the same advancing research goals. I continue to focus on the overall goal of our project to determine active soil viral communities and how they contribute to soil ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. This was achieved by placing dry soil from a grassland in microcosmos and wetting soil with either water or water with isotopically heavy oxygen (18O) with and without phosphorus. The microcosms were sampled weekly for viromics, stable isotope probing (SIP)-viromics, SIP-metagenomics (track microbial hosts), metatranscriptomics (gene expression), and microbial respiration. The stated objects of the proposal are:
1.	Identify and quantify microbial and viral populations with 18O metagenomes and viromes.
2.	Quantify the impact of increased soil phosphorus concentration on microbial and viral populations.
3.	Characterize bacterial and viral populations found in eDNA and determine their persistence in soil.
4.	Identify the genetic potentials of microbes and viruses and characterize virus-microbe interactions. 
While still exploring the original objectives, new data became available (metatranscriptomic) that was not originally proposed, allowing a unique perspective to virus activity not previously explored. Layering this new data onto our proposed data, we found that viral community composition of the virome and active viruses were significantly different (Figure 1). We investigated each virus type individually to observe how wet-up and phosphorus addition impacted soil viruses and virus-host dynamics. We found that viral community composition and richness (unique viral species per sample) responded to wet-up regardless of the virus type (virome or transcriptionally active) (Figure 2). Additionally, we saw that the relative abundance of viruses with similar predicted hosts responded to wet-up and phosphorus additions. These results led to the finding that both viromes and active viruses respond to wet-up, although at different time scales, and that within soils, phosphorus plays a role in viral infection dynamics. Our next work will involve incorporating SIP -viromic and -metagenomic data (pioneered at LLNL) with environmental DNA and host activity to characterize virus-host dynamics, allowing use to fully explore our proposed objectives."
,L24GF7839,Awarded,Noncontact Ultrasonic Robotic Inspection of Nuclear Waste Storage Drums,UC Lab Fees Research Program,LFRP 2024 In-Residence National Laboratory Graduate Fellows,National Lab Graduate Fellow,167400,2024-04-01,2026-03-31,Izabela Cristina Batista,ibatista@ucsd.edu,"University of California, San Diego",,National Lab Graduate Fellow,,"Assessing the integrity of nuclear waste storage drums is critical for ensuring safe nuclear waste disposal, which is of significant concern to the Nation and, more specifically, to National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) laboratories and production facilities. The failure of these drums can be catastrophic, exposing personnel and assets to radioactive contamination. For instance, a breach in a drum at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in 2014 resulted in a $54 million fine for the U.S. Department of Energy. Thus, the need to frequently and reliably monitor the structural integrity of these storage drums is clear.
Current inspection techniques rely on human examination of containers stored in underground facilities, using handheld sensors. This process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and exposes personnel to a hazardous environment. Developing robots for autonomous inspection of nuclear waste drums could address these challenges and enable the reliable inspection of hard-to-reach hazardous areas.
My current research focuses on real-time defect detection on metallic structures using noncontact air-coupled ultrasonic transducers. To demonstrate this technology, our team attaches a sensor-holding prototype, developed in-house, under a train car and collects data from rails while the train travels. The data consists of ultrasonic guided waves generated by the wheel-rail friction that leaks into air. Under the guidance of Dr. Lanza di Scalea, I developed algorithms that combine signal and image processing techniques, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning to transform the data into a 97% probability of defect detection using an unsupervised learning approach. My proposed project will demonstrate that this methodology is independent of the structure being inspected, and I can expand it to detect flaws in not only nuclear waste storage drums, but also nuclear reactors and their components.
Working with LANL will provide me with the resources to ultimately develop a successful autonomous inspection device. The Laboratory is a major stakeholder at WIPP, with access to the structures of interest, the sensors used for inspection, previously acquired data, and a skilled robotics team. Dr. Farrar is a world leader in Structural Health Monitoring and his mentorship and knowledge on the subject matter will be invaluable for the success of this project.","This research focuses on developing a robotic inspection system that uses ultrasonic waves to detect structural damage and sealing issues in nuclear waste storage drums. These drums must remain intact to prevent radiological release events. Current inspection methods have limitations, including incomplete coverage, reliance on visual inspections, and the risk of exposing inspectors to radiation. The goal of this project is to create a fully automated, non-contact system capable of efficiently scanning drums and detecting early-stage damage, ultimately enhancing long-term safety in nuclear waste storage facilities.
During this reporting period, we achieved key milestones in our research. We conducted an in-depth review of existing inspection techniques and identified critical gaps, particularly in detecting internal defects and monitoring sealing gaskets. We then developed computer simulations to understand how ultrasonic waves travel through the metal drum and how various types of damage affect wave propagation. These insights guided our selection of the most suitable sensors and hardware for the robotic system. Additionally, we designed and built a prototype robotic scanner that rotates the drum while acquiring data. The system is now nearly complete, and experimental testing is scheduled to begin once approvals are finalized.
One major challenge we faced was the significant delay in obtaining the Laboratory-required safety training and the procurement of specialized equipment, which postponed our experimental work. To overcome this, we focused on advanced computer modeling, allowing us to refine our inspection approach before physical testing begins. This adaptation strengthened our research by ensuring a more effective system design.
Our most significant breakthrough was envisioning a new method to monitor the drum's sealing gasket using ultrasonic waves. We found that changes in the gasket’s compression affect how the waves propagate through this interface, allowing us to track its condition over time. This is a novel application with potential benefits beyond nuclear waste storage.
In the next phase, we will test our robotic inspection system on these drums, evaluate its accuracy in detecting both synthetic and real defects, and refine the technology based on the results."

Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are highly promising candidates because of their tunable mechanical properties and easy manufacturability. However, existing SPEs often exceed a thickness of 100 μm, compromising the energy density advantage of LMBs. To address this conundrum, we propose to leverage high-resolution 3D printing, an additive manufacturing technology, to fabricate ultrathin porous membranes (in collaboration with the LLNL mentor, Dr. Jianchao Ye). These membranes will serve as a foundation for the fabrication of ultrathin SPEs (approximately 20 μm) with precise formulations, physicochemical properties, and mechanical characteristics for solid-state LMBs. Three interrelated tasks are proposed to achieve the project’s overarching goal: (1) Fabrication and optimization of ultrathin SPEs based on 3D-printed membranes, allowing for tunable porosity, thickness, and pattern. As a model system, we will incorporate the polyacrylate-based polymer (previously developed by our group) with 3D-printed membranes to assess compatibility. (2) Integration of an additive-engineering strategy to stabilize the lithium-SPE interface. Various film-forming additives will be introduced into the ultrathin SPEs, aiming to formulate stable solid-electrolyte interphases and eliminate corrosive side reactions on the anode side. (3) Incorporation of functional ceramic fillers into ultrathin SPEs to enhance dendritic suppression capability. Our plan involves introducing functional fillers, including ceramic anode materials that exhibit zero-volt stability. These fillers will enable the self-consumption of any lithium filament formed inside SPEs, thereby improving the safety performance of the battery. 

The unique facilities to be used in the LLNL includes the Advanced Manufacturing Lab. AML houses commercial and home-build 3D printers, including BMF S130 and S240 printers, Large-Area Projection Microlithography system, Nanoscribe based on two-photon polymerization, direct ink writing systems, binder-jet printer, selective laser sintering systems and Volumetric Additive Manufacturing systems.","This project leverages 3D printing techniques to fabricate ultra-thin scaffolds (<100 µm thickness) with a well-defined 3D structure, aiming to enable high-energy-density (>350 Wh/kg) lithium metal batteries. Significant progress has been made in developing high-performance ink formulations, utilizing HDDA resin to create 3D scaffolds with a zig-zag structure, which enhances mechanical stability and battery integration. Various structural designs were tested to optimize scaffold integrity, while cathode ink infiltration into the designated cathode channels was successfully achieved. Additionally, the integration of solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) with 3D scaffolds using in-situ polymerization was explored as a promising approach for improved performance.
Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. Membrane shrinkage during drying, suboptimal wetting properties affecting cathode ink infiltration, undesirable penetration of cathode ink into anode channels, and excessive polymerization at the scaffold bottom due to high light intensity during printing have been observed. Furthermore, anode ink infiltration was hindered by poor lithium wetting with the scaffold and narrow (~50 µm) anode channels, while consistent defect-free porous membrane production remains a key challenge for optimized battery assembly.
Key achievements include the successful printing of 3D scaffolds with a zig-zag structure, demonstrating the potential to deliver an energy density of 350 Wh/kg, while achieving a thin 50 µm skeleton with desirable porosity and mechanical stability. Additionally, cathode ink filling, thermal curing of SPE in glass fiber with good ionic conductivity, and post-treatment drying processes were successfully implemented while maintaining structural integrity. Notably, the issue of drying shrinkage was effectively mitigated through a solution exchange process followed by drying under mild constraint, ensuring improved membrane integrity and dimensional stability.
Future efforts will focus on:
1.	Optimizing anode ink infiltration, SPE integration, and polymerization for full 3D battery assembly.
2.	Assessing electrochemical performance, including rate capability, cycling stability, and further increasing energy density.
3.	Expanding compatibility with alternative cathode and anode materials.
4.	Integrating functional fillers to enhance battery lifespan.
These advancements will contribute to the realization of high-energy-density lithium metal batteries with scalable and reproducible 3D architectures, paving the way for next-generation energy storage technologies."

Within LLNL, it also underpins several of core missions, such as the Stockpile Stewardship program. Although corrosion is a thermodynamically driven process, its practical impact can be minimized by controlling key chemical processes that dictate the early stages of corrosion initiation. However, most existing corrosion and aging models are developed to describe the steady-state conditions that occur late in the reaction. To address this critical knowledge gap, this proposal will integrate state-of-the-art experimental characterization, multiscale simulations, and data science to elucidate factors that control initiation of localized corrosion—one of the most notorious processes that degrade materials. 
This proposal will focus on Aluminum (Al) and Al-based alloys that are highly relevant to ongoing LLNL activities. An initial study of polycrystalline, single-phase Al will provide a foundational for more complex alloys where impurities, inclusions, and phase segregation are also considered. We aim to investigate when and how local localized corrosion is impacted by variations in the local structure and composition due to the delocalized nature of galvanic processes. To this end, the graduate student will leverage state-of-the-art surface probes and electrochemical techniques at LLNL to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution of corrosion processes, with scales ranging from nanometers to 1000 microns. Orientation and element specific multimodal electron microscopy will be used together with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The student will also be trained to model materials corrosion with multiscale simulations and data science approaches. In particular, orientation, compositions and work function derived from electron microscopy, SECM, and ab-initio simulations will provide inputs for a machine learning model that to provide a priori indicators of where degradation will initiate. Model predictions will be validated through in situ AFM coupled with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This close feedback between experiments and modeling will provide an unprecedented view of how materials degradation starts and proceeds.","Our project focuses on understanding the corrosion behavior of advanced engineered materials, specifically 3D-printed nickel-based high entropy alloys. These compositionally complex alloys, contain multiple elements such as Al, Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni in near-equal proportions and would be relevant as materials in energy, healthcare, and advanced technologies. We investigated how heat treatment affects these materials' mechanical properties and corrosion resistance.
The investigation was based on electrochemical tests and advanced microscopy techniques on samples treated at different temperatures. A major finding was the unexpected inverse relationship between mechanical strength and corrosion resistance in the heat-treated samples. For instance, samples annealed at 1000 °C showed increased strength but poor corrosion resistance as compared to the non-annealed sample.
We overcame several challenges, in (i) developing suitable surface preparation techniques, (ii) setting up atomic force microscopy (AFM) experimentation, and (iii) correlation between Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and AFM. Overcoming the challenges allowed us to obtain high-resolution images of the material's surface structure.
Major accomplishments of the study, thus far, include identifying selective phase dissolution in the heat-treated samples, observing more numerous corrosion pits in the annealed samples, and successfully demonstrating that selective dissolution and pitting are independent phenomena. We also investigated corrosion in various pH environments to mimic the real-world conditions.
In the future, we plan to investigate the mechanisms behind the strength-corrosion trade-off, with an aim of developing strategies to enhance corrosion resistance without compromising mechanical properties. 
This research is advancing our understanding of material degradation in ways that could significantly impact future material design for critical applications. We are deeply thankful for this opportunity and remain committed to pushing the boundaries of materials science in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), working alongside renowned scientists and contributing to the lab’s global security mission."

WSe2, MoTe2 and HfTe5 are van der Waals materials - a class of materials that exhibit weak out-of-plane bonding which allows them to be mechanically exfoliated into atomically thin two-dimensional sheets. It has been demonstrated that strain provides a controllable method to tune the electronic properties of other van der Waals materials. Twisted bilayer WSe2 exhibits tunable electronic phases such as superconductivity and correlated insulating states by changing twist angle between stacked monolayers. MoTe2, a type-II Weyl semimetal in the bulk and a small-gap semiconductor in the single layer limit, is a promising candidate for high temperature superconductivity and has demonstrated pressure-driven electronic band tuning. HfTe5 is an emerging Dirac semimetal that demonstrates various topological electronic phases such as the anomalous hall effect. I plan to explore the optical and electronic responses of these materials with varying strain methods including static and dynamic strain. Our laboratory at UCI specializes in imparting different degrees and types of strain onto layered materials. Our strain methods include piezo-driven surface acoustic waves—a dynamic method to impart oscillating strain fields, a Razorbill strain apparatus that may applying uniaxial strain by stretching, and bending apparatuses which may controllably bend the layered materials using a 4-point and 3-point bending stage. Utilizing the Titan transmission electron microscope (TEM) in LANL’s Electron Microscopy Lab, we will conduct four-dimensional scanning TEM (4D-STEM) measurements on our MoTe2, WSe2, and HfTe5 crystals to characterize their crystal structure and the moiré patterns. We will perform magneto-optical measurements and magneto-electrical measurements at Los Alamos’ High Magnetic Field laboratory. With varying degrees of material strain, we will conduct transport measurements, Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy in the labs of Han Htoon and Michael Pettes.","I proposed conducting a comprehensive study on the effects of strain on quantum materials, specifically focusing on twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and thin HfTe5 flakes. The first aim was to complete an ongoing study of strain effects on twisted WSe2. While we did observe changes in Raman spectra with strain, this was unconclusive as to the nature of the strain. To elucidate the nature of strain in twisted WSe2 we measured conductive AFM images across twisted WSe2 samples and observed reconstructed moiré patterns. We then moved on to conduct electric measurements on the twisted WSe2 samples but found that the contact resistance due to the large Schottky barrier was too large to overcome and good electrical transport data could not be taken at low temperature. We then began an effort to make good electrical contacts to TMD’s using another layered material, RuCl3. An hBN-encapsulated device was made of MoTe2 monolayer in contact with a RuCl3 flake and magnetoresistance was measured at low temperatures showing ohmic contact down to cryogenic temperatures (4K). This will allow low temperature strain-dependent electronic measurements to be performed. The next step of integrating these devices into surface acoustic wave modulated devices is under way. We plan to carefully measure conductivity in these devices by measuring SAW attenuation induced by our devices and expect to observe quantum oscillations. We then plan to use SAWs to carefully tune the electronic phases of our devices and measure them using RuCl3-enabled ohmic contact to MoTe2."

Recently, more and more data is becoming available due to the wide deployment of smart meters, smart sensors, and upgraded communication networks. Thus, data-driven control techniques, especially reinforcement learning (RL), have attracted surging attention for DERs coordination and control. However, major hurdles remain before the deployment of RL for DERs control. For power systems, failure to maintain stability and safety can lead to violation of regulatory requirements or even catastrophic consequences, e.g., blackouts. In addition, traditional RL relies on extensive data to succeed, while data for power system operations is typically limited and data collection can be time-consuming.
This proposal outlines a systematic framework for integrating control-theoretic tools into RL to learn provably stable, robust, and data-efficient control policies for DER coordination and control. In a series of recent works from PI Jie Feng and his advisor Yuanyuan Shi’s research, we have developed a novel stability-constrained RL framework that incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to ensure policy stability. Built on the promising results, we will further characterize the benefit of the integration of prior model knowledge and offline data for improving the data efficiency of RL, as well as promoting the robustness of learned policy with respect to various model and environmental uncertainties. This project will in collaboration with Dr. Deepjyoti Deka at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), who brings a wealth of expertise in machine learning, optimization, and cybersecurity for aggregations of smart flexible resources. Dr. Deka and his collaborators at LANL have access to an experimental testbed for coordinated TCLs at LANL, that will facilitate the experimental validation of the real-time distributed control trials in our proposed framework. This project marks a significant step towards learning-based DER control and coordination architectures. This aligns with LANL’s competencies in experimental energy systems and data driven control, thereby promoting reliable AI-enabled methodologies for DER management.","Overview: Collaborating with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), this project develops data-driven controllers with stability and robustness guarantees in future grids with high renewable penetration. Key aims: (1) incorporate Lyapunov stability with reinforcement learning (RL); (2) integrate steady-state optimality into RL; (3) robustness to power grid topology changes and sensor delays.

Progress: I stayed at LANL for the Summer 2024 (early Jun to end of Sep) and the Winter 2025 (Jan), and at UC San Diego in Spring and Fall 2024, completing Aim 1 and Aim 2.

For Aim 1, we designed an RL controller for power grid frequency control with stability guarantees under variable inertia. To address the challenge of time-varying system control, we modeled the frequency control as a switching system, identified a common Lyapunov function, and designed a neural-network-based proportional-integral (Neural-PI) controller to ensure stability. An online learning algorithm was proposed to adaptively select the best pre-trained controller. This work resulted in two IEEE publications, ref [1] and [2].

Towards Aim 2, we designed a framework combining RL controller with optimization, ensuring stability, steady-state optimality, and flexibility for transient performance. Implemented in power grid
voltage control, this work is published in [3].

Barriers that were overcome: Identifying suitable Lyapunov functions for complex nonlinear systems remains challenging. We addressed this by developing a learning-based framework for automatic
Lyapunov function discovery. Initial results have been published in [4].

List of the publications/talks: Outcomes were presented at the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning ([4]), the 2024 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control ([1]), and the 2025 LANL
Grid Science Winter School ([2]). 3 journal papers and 1 conference paper were published, detailed in the narrative.

Plans: Our main goal is to finish Aim 3 and validate our methods in PowerModels.jl, LANL’s large-scale power grid simulation testbed. In collaboration with Dr. Deka, we are developing a topology-switch
detection algorithm for distribution grids to enhance robustness against topology changes. We also plan to generalize the local controllers to a distributed voltage control framework and further explore
the properties of nonlinear power flow models."

The recent breakthrough in achieving controlled ignition at LLNL’s National Ignition Facility has sparked renewed interest in advanced methods for Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE). However, the conventional ignition method relies on intense laser beams to drive both compression and heating in the target, which restricts the maximum efficiency and feasibility for energy applications. Electron Fast Ignition (EFI) is an exciting alternative that decouples these processes by first compressing the fuel and then heating the target with laser-generated electrons, which can yield more energy for fusion. Generating hot electrons from lasers is very efficient but depositing their energy into the fusion fuel poses a two-fold challenge: 1) electrons tend to scatter away before reaching the target, and 2) many of the electrons are too energetic to stop in the target center. In order to tackle these two challenges LLNL has recently funded an IFE Strategic Initiative in which the lab mentor is leading a study of the complex electron physics in EFI. As part of this broader campaign, the fellowship work will focus on developing a comprehensive understanding of how electron collimation depends on resistivity gradients – these are responsible for pushing electrons into collimated beams. Direct measurement of the resistivity gradient is challenging; instead, it must be inferred from electron conductivity models together with temperature measurements – both are crucial for understanding the collimation mechanism. The measurements will be made utilizing the lab’s unique time-resolved spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy instruments at facilities such as LLNL’s Jupiter Laser Facility. Selecting conductivity models requires caution, especially in the low-temperature regime where matter is not yet fully ionized. For this, we will leverage expertise from my previous graduate work in detailed electronic structure modeling for regimes where simpler models don’t work as well. The same experimental and modeling techniques will address the second challenge of stopping electrons in the target center. The goal of this work is to provide first-of-their-kind benchmark measurements and to improve the predictive capability of codes used for future EFI campaigns, enabling progress toward a clean fusion energy future.",

Tungsten, with its high melting point and superior thermal and mechanical properties, emerges as a leading candidate for plasma-facing materials. Nevertheless, tungsten's exposure to high-energy particles and severe thermal conditions can induce irradiation damage, manifesting as void swelling and progressive material degradation. Developing tungsten alloys with improved irradiation resistance, reduced void swelling, and enhanced high temperature durability is crucial for the long-term success and safety of fusion reactors.

This research program aims to demonstrate an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to efficiently sample the vast compositional space for accelerating the design of ultrastrong tungsten alloys with improved radiation swelling resistance. By collaborating with a scientist at LLNL, my objective is to deploy a closed-loop design framework combining recent AI, scientific machine learning, and atomistic simulations. Utilizing on-lattice atomic structure and chemistry model developed by my advisor, alongside machine learning models from our lab mentor, I plan to model the entire refractory space. Our goal is to accurately and efficiently predict defect diffusion barriers, aiming to trap and localize defects and reduce void growth through precise chemical manipulation. This project aligns perfectly with my training and career objectives, offering an invaluable opportunity for specialized training at a national laboratory. Through the In-Residence Fellowship, I will access world-class computational resources and receive comprehensive mentorship from both my UC dissertation advisor and a national lab mentor. This experience will enhance my technical skills, broaden my scientific network, and support my ambition to become a scientist at a national laboratory, contributing to scientific advancements in material science and renewable energy research.",

It is determined by the dry mass and water content of fuels, influenced by water potential (an indicator of plant water stress), and varies with environmental conditions and plant traits over days to months. In both dead and live fuels, moisture content can vary seasonally by 100% and diurnally by 10%, with significant differences among fuel types. Contemporary fire behavior models incorporate fuel moisture as a key variable but often rely on limited and generalized fuel classifications based on average estimations of fuel size and type. This simplification overlooks the variability in fuels and their interactions with environmental conditions. Additionally, changing climate regimes and extreme drought conditions necessitate an updated understanding of moisture response in forest fuels, especially during wildfire seasons. Our research aims to bridge this gap by investigating real-time variations in fuel moisture content from a biophysical perspective. By investigating water transport processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum for live and dead forest fuels, we aim to link water potential to fuel moisture using pressure–volume curves. We will also analyze how climatic factors such as precipitation, temperature, and evaporation affect fuel moisture from individual plants to entire forests and ecosystems. Field measurements of fuel moisture content will be supplemented with remote sensing data from MODIS and Sentinel-1. These insights will be integrated into ensemble deep learning models for real-time updates and predictions. By providing high-resolution and real-time fuel moisture estimation and prediction, and integrating these data into existing fire models, such as QUIC-Fire and FIRETEC, we aim to enhance these models' capabilities from ideal experimental landscapes and fuel structures to real-world scenarios. Our research seeks to make contributions to the field of fire behavior modeling and prescribed fire planning, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of fire management strategies. This project will be a collaborative effort between Los Alamos National Lab and UC Irvine. The fuel moisture measurement experiment will be conducted at the national lab's facilities, while workstations and high-performance computing resources at UCI will be used for data analysis and modeling.",

Soil fungi have demonstrated a responsiveness to their environment and are capable of allocating growth and altering the composition of organic exudates in response to contrasting mineral substrates and nutrient conditions. While fungal hyphae operate at the microscale, fungal networks span millions of kilometers worldwide, significantly contributing to soil formation, mineral weathering, and nutrient cycling processes at landscape scales. However, it is difficult to assess the active growth of the soil fungal population as a majority of the fungal network is dormant or senesced. This work will utilize stable isotope tracing methods (13C) to investigate the active use of plant-derived carbon by soil fungi in controlled laboratory experiments. Fungal-accessible mesh bags containing unweathered rock (quartz, granite, basalt) will be buried in the soil of sorghum growth chambers as part of a 13CO2-enriched experiment at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Upon retrieval, Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS) will be utilized to map and characterize the 13C-enrichment of fungal biomass and mineral-associated exudates. To investigate the integration of 13C into fungal DNA, density gradient separations will be performed and High-Throughput Stable Isotope Probing (HT-SIP) will be employed, allowing for sequencing (amplicon or metagenomic) and taxonomic and functional identification. Ultimately this work aims to leverage stable isotope tracing methods to advance our understanding of the use and integration of photosynthetic carbon by soil fungi. This work coincides well with the DOE-BER mission of understanding the role of Earth's biogeochemical systems in climate-geosphere-biosphere interactions through the study of environmental systems at different spatial scales. More specifically, this research aims to advance a mechanistic understanding of the biological drivers that influence enhanced rock weathering, and ultimately, the distribution and persistence of organic carbon in soil.",

This process occurs when peripheral nerves that detect pathogens or inflammation are activated and relay this information back to the central nervous system. In the brain, this information is coordinated in unique brain centers, resulting in neuronal signaling and the release of neurotransmitters that can alter physiology in various organs. Many immune cells are responsive to neurotransmitters, and a few subtypes are also capable of producing and releasing them. For example, a highly specialized subset of B- and T-cells express the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and can release acetylcholine. Previous work has shown that ChAT+ immune cells can regulate immune cell recruitment during viral infection of the meninges, which surround the brain and spinal cord. During viral encephalitis, immune cells penetrate the blood brain barrier and increase inflammation detrimentally, with long-lasting impacts in speech, memory, and sleep in some patients.  The precise mechanisms by which immune cells are recruited into the brain, and the role of neuroimmune circuits in their recruitment and activation, remain undefined. Defining the immune cell subsets that induce maladaptive inflammation in the brain and the mechanisms that lead to their recruitment is critical to identify potential targets for limiting immunopathology during viral encephalitis. The proposed research utilizes the expertise of researchers at LLNL in infectious disease and single cell transcriptomics. To elucidate if neuroimmune circuits can reduce immunopathology during viral infection, mouse models of encephalitic viral pathogens currently established in Dr. Weilhammer’s lab will be used alongside preexisting electrical neurostimulation procedures and unique genetic models from Dr. Reardon’s lab. Additionally, the use of LLNL’s established single-cell RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis pipeline will be leveraged to gain insight into the mechanisms by which neuroimmune circuits modulate cell behavior during viral infection and aid in the identification of potential therapeutic targets. These studies will identify if neuroimmune communication can reduce virally induced encephalitis, the role of specific immune cells, and receptors that could mediate these protective effects.",

The recent discovery of stable atomic-scale two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, provides a fundamental route towards the understanding of charge carrier interactions, enabled by the extremely strong Coulomb interactions and light absorption in these 2D atomic crystals. Our efforts in this regard have ranged from high carrier density plasmas to many-particle neutral and charged electronic states, to single-exciton-photon interactions involving coherent fields, to heterojunction charge dynamics in next-generation device applications.     In this UC-NL CRT program, our synergistic team proposes to establish UC scientific leadership in atomic-scale semiconductor optoelectronics, with five correlated Thrusts of high impact: (1) Atomic-scale 2D materials definition: growth, microscopy and defect control with atomic granularity; (2) Many-body excitonic interactions and dynamics in the 2D heterostructures; (3) Single exciton-photon interactions in the 2D heterostructures; (4) Interfaces and contacts to the 2D heterostructures; and (5) Integrated early-career scientist, postdoctoral, and student training, with diversity emphasis.

The drought was bracketed by two extremely wet years in 2010 and 2016, and was accompanied by unprecedented tree mortality and wildfire in California’s wildlands. Over the 21st century, climate scientists predict continued warming and an increase in swings between extremely wet and dry conditions. Since wet conditions favor vegetation regrowth and fuels buildup, and warm, dry conditions favor forest dieback and wildfire, these predictions raise questions critical for California’s future: Are the extreme forest dieback and fire conditions seen during the recent drought a harbinger of even greater future changes? What do future changes mean for California’s unique ecosystems, forest and fire management practices, and economy?     Here we propose an effort to answer these questions through collaboration among climate scientists, satellite experts, vegetation modelers, fire scientists, and ecologists. The project will be grounded in analysis of observed relationships between fire, tree mortality, and climatic conditions during the recent drought. We will then develop computer simulations of climate, vegetation, and fire to determine the causes of recent tree mortality and fire variations. We will quantify the role of recent climate change in worsening the observed forest dieback and fire. The project’s capstone will be high-resolution climate change projections to simulate the impact of warming and increases in precipitation extremes on 21st century vegetation growth, fire, and forest dieback. We will also assess how future forest and fire management might evolve to mitigate the largest impacts of climate change on California’s wildlands.     The first-of-their-kind climate, vegetation, and fire simulations will deepen our understanding of the complex interactions within California’s wildlands, and will leave a technological legacy in the form of a modeling framework that is easily applied to other regions.

","The project was a collaboration between climate scientists, satellite experts, vegetation modelers, fire scientists, ecologists, and graduate student researchers to analyze the recent period in order to diagnose relevant relationships between drought, fire, vegetation, and tree mortality. Using these results as a base, we have advanced our understanding of wildfire drivers to have better constrained projections of fire probability and severity across California in a 21st century climate. Together with the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Los Alamos National Lab and the UC campuses of Davis, Irvine, Berkeley, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles, we exceeded the goals that were initially proposed: modeling and analysis of long-term human and lightning-caused ignitions across the state of California to help improve fire risk assessment and provide guidance for fire prevention and land management to limit future fire hazard; analyzed fire-climate relationships, fire impact on CA ecosystems and vegetation dynamics in CA dryland ecosystems using various datasets; explored the use of statistical and machine learning approaches to project future changes in California’s carbon storage as a consequence of climate change; used Functionally Assembled Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) to simulate forest structure and composition across the Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest; examined the flammability of species in fire-prone ecosystems under different water stress; and produced 21st century climate change projections for California at high resolution.

As the deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar panels and energy storage devices is proliferating, electricity distribution systems are becoming drastically more complex and more dynamic. There are numerous inputs and controls pushed and pulled from these emerging energy resources and other grid equipment, some of which connect the resources to the public Internet. Further, the installation of millions of smart electricity meters and recent breakthroughs in micro-synchrophasor sensors and smart inverter controls are accelerating the rate at which measurement data is generated and control commands are dispatched. However, these technological advancements in sensing, controls, and communications of electricity distribution systems have exposed this critical infrastructure to new vulnerabilities, threatening its functionality and reliability. Each of the new layers of data integration and control that are being added to electric distribution systems can create new cyberattack surfaces and privacy breaches that are yet to be identified, understood, and quantified; and this challenges the vision of a renewed and more efficient electric grid. Traditionally, the focus in cybersecurity of electricity infrastructures has been on securing large power plants and control centers. In contrast, this project will create a paradigm shift to make serious efforts also to secure DERs and electricity distribution networks, through enhanced and comprehensive cybersecurity measures, reinforced by physical measures such as electric isolation. Otherwise, attacks could compromise a number of distributed cyber and physical components, turning them into ""physical botnets"" against the electricity infrastructure – analogous to how computer botnets work in distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) in the Internet.

This project built a new knowledge base to address both theoretical and practical challenges in electricity distribution cybersecurity. The technical tasks in this project were multi-disciplinary and organized in three research thrust areas. First, the project team addressed the vulnerability and risk assessment in this domain. In this task, the project team identified and modeled where and how the cyber-physical devices in the electricity distribution system can be affected by potential threats at different sensing, controls, and communications layers. The project also systematically quantified the likelihood of each threat, including both security and privacy breaches. Accordingly, we also assessed the adverse impacts in failing to prevent those threats of high risk. Second, the project team developed methodologies for cyber-attack detection and defense mechanisms. Attack detection was achieved by combining cybersecurity measures with physics-aware methods as an additional layer of security. Multi-layer defense mechanisms were developed that utilized cyber-physical resources to mitigate impacts and cascading failures. Third, the project also included various testing activities to make industry recommendations. The case studies were done based not only computer simulations but also real-world data sets. Building upon the many test capabilities and facilities available across the UC campuses and the national labs, the project team conducted evaluations of the proposed methodologies.

To enable California to optimize future water infrastructure, legislation, and economy, scientists at 5 UC campuses, LLNL, and LBL will measure and model water from headwaters in the Sierra Nevada, through rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater in the Central Valley. The approach is to examine hydrologic sensitivities to changing climate and water demand through models and the historical record. The goal is to provide information to optimize water storage, quality, and groundwater sustainability as precipitation varies, temperatures warm, and population grows. To consider the range of headwater-to-groundwater systems, we focus on three river basins comprising different climatic, geologic, and socio-economic settings -- Shasta R (volcanic, northernmost, lowest, wettest), Kings R (granitic, southernmost, driest, highest, poorest), and the American R (metamorphic, wealthiest). Novel methods to monitor and model ongoing and future changes in rain and snowmelt in the headwaters will be coupled with process-driven modeling and measurement of evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, and withdrawal in the lowlands. Models will consider changes in water policy and infrastructure, and resulting impacts on energy production and consumption. Collaboration between the Campuses and Labs will build teams that include people in all career stages who study aspects of the water cycle from remote sensing of snow to water policy. Collaborators from LLNL and LBL contribute expertise in isotopic tracing of water, high-performance computer modeling of groundwater and surface water, and energy implications of water management. This proposal strengthens DOE’s mission, to ensure America's security and prosperity by addressing energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges through science and technology. The alliance between UC faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and students with scientists at LLNL and LBL will improve understanding of how changing climate and water demand will affect water resources through the middle to the end of this century. Our proposal will nurture a generation of scientists in the nexus of climate, water, and energy. An advisory board of water practitioners will help target our findings to help water managers make the best decisions for California’s precious water resources.","The fundamental targets of our investigation considered the way that changes in climate and hydrology affect the suite of chemical, biological, geophysical, and socioeconomic processes that shape California’s water system. A warming climate increases the chance of co-occurring warm temperatures and lack of precipitation, causes some of the precipitation in the headwaters to fall as rain instead of snow, melts snow earlier in the spring, and increases rates of evapotranspiration in the lowlands, foothills, and mountains. The investigation advanced the basic understanding of the important connections between water supply from the Sierra Nevada snowpack and demand from agriculture and urban areas, for example:

•	Feasibility and social, hydrologic, and climatic constraints on managed aquifer recharge to improve groundwater sustainability. Prospects for managed aquifer recharge are compromised by water rights and by lack of plans for funding, and lack of enough surface water limits effectiveness of managed aquifer recharge, especially in the southern part of the Central Valley.
•	Development of a comprehensive surface-groundwater model that can link to larger scale hydrology and climate for future management decisions. The unique set of isotopic data collected will support future work in identifying pathways of water movement.
•	Improvement in remotely sensed retrievals of snow properties. Reconstruction of the seasonal snow cover’s volumes places each year in perspective, and accurate albedo measurements enable short-term runoff forecasts.
•	Identifying an opportunity to provide more water by reducing uncertainty in forecasts. Comparison of forecasts of snowmelt runoff with water releases shows a significant effect of the uncertainty.

The unexpected barrier we encountered was COVID-19. The pandemic hampered our ability to hold workshops with stakeholders, and it constrained regional meetings about groundwater management. The years of low precipitation prevented completion of our managed recharge experiment.

The award created a diverse network of early-career through senior researchers, leading to subsequent awards that will enable investigating this topic of water moving from headwaters to groundwaters in support of water management decisions. The award supported 5 postdoctoral fellows and 8 PhD students."

The majority of these emissions come from manure, where emission rates are thought to differ greatly among different manure management techniques. In order to fulfill statewide emission reduction goals for short-lived climate pollutants, the California Air Resources Board has recently targeted CH4 emission sources for near-term mitigation. However, few studies of CH4 emissions from dairy manure have been performed in California. Recent top-down atmospheric observations and inverse model analyses of atmospheric CH4 and N2O levels in the San Joaquin Valley suggest that emissions from dairy agriculture are underestimated in the state inventory. However, the dearth of California-specific information leads to uncertainty in the state inventory that poses an obstacle to efficient, well-informed mitigation planning for emissions from this sector. In addition, the efficacy of proposed mitigation solutions, such as anerobic digesters for manure waste, is not well quantified or tested in practice. We propose to combine top-down atmospheric methods with bottom-up process-level measurements and operational insight to improve both facility specific and regionally integrated estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from management practices at California dairies. Using a unique combination of subject area knowledge, high resolution data sets, biogeochemistry, atmospheric composition observations, and inversion modeling, we will quantify and apportion CH4 and N2O emissions to their sources with the goal of improving understanding of the driving processes and their respective control techniques. By working across scales, we will provide an integrated regional emissions estimate with sufficient detail to unambiguously quantify dairy livestock emissions as distinct from other greenhouse gas sources. This study will give a thorough scientific treatment to the greenhouse gas emissions from the entire manure management cycle in ways that have been done for other CH4 emitting sectors, such as natural gas, to enable complete, empirically informed mitigation decisions.  ","Here we work to improve methane (CH4) emission estimates from manure management on California dairies using a range of methods across scales. We built a fine-scale spatial inventory of CH4 emissions at the farm scale that included regional management and climate information. This provided a baseline estimate of statewide CH4 emissions at a scale that could be used to evaluate whether CH4 mitigation actions. We found that the current statewide greenhouse gas monitoring system does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect expected changes in CH4 emissions from planned mitigation such as anaerobic digesters. Spatial and temporally resolved inventories should be used for planning observations intended to verify the success of emission reduction efforts. We demonstrated that these inventories can be rapidly updated using aerial imagery and artificial intelligence tools. We made multiple types of atmospheric measurements across scales to investigate their ability to quantify CH4 emissions and detect changes across seasons. Estimates of CH4 emissions from larger scales, including regional tower inversions and ground-based solar absorption spectrometry are hampered by a lack of observations; for tower inversions, due to lack of sensitivity to dairy emissions in key regions, and for small scales of observation, due to insufficiently accurate wind products. Nevertheless, seasonal differences were observed, with unexpectedly high CH4 emissions in wintertime. CH4 emission estimates at the farm scale also proved challenge given high spatial and temporal variability in emission rates. Emissions of CH4 and nitrous oxide from soils receiving manure application were highly variable in space and time within a growing season, but these differences were reduced during a drought year, illustrating multiple timescales of variability and the role of soil moisture. CH4 emissions from manure lagoons also exhibited a high degree of spatial and temporal variability, attributable to management practices and temperature. Diurnal patterns appeared correlated with temperature, but require further study. Source apportionment tracers such as the stable carbon isotope of CH4 can be used to distinguish emissions from enteric fermentation and manure sources. Future work that compares CH4 emissions from observations and inventory requires products that have the same spatial and temporal scale."

Competing signals of photosynthesis and respiration subject large-scale estimates of gross primary production to considerable uncertainty. The proposal at hand seeks to fill this critical knowledge gap by leveraging atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) as a tracer for photosynthesis. Carbonyl sulfide is taken up by plants concurrently with CO2, but, whereas CO2 is also respired, COS is irreversibly transformed. As such, the magnitude of COS uptake over land can serve as a proxy for gross primary production.  In order to accomplish this, I propose to modify the Sulfur Transport Eulerian Model (STEM) to model the transport and photosynthetic drawdown of COS over the Amazon basin. This approach has been successfully applied over North America and, with recent large-scale COS data collection campaigns beginning in the Amazon, now is an ideal time to apply the method to the tropics. These data will be used in the inverse component of STEM to better constrain surface fluxes.  In addition to being optimally timed for data collection, the proposed research can also inform and use results from the ongoing Accelerated Climate Model for Energy project to which LLNL is a large contributor. The ACME model can be used to provide dynamic boundary conditions for regional-scale simulations, while results from STEM can provide high-resolution information about plant-related surface fluxes, consistent with ACME’s focus on biogeochemical and water cycles. Further work in both models is also needed to accurately model oceanic emissions of COS.  Harnessing these models in tandem will allow for better understanding of the transport of COS and, by proxy, atmosphere-biosphere CO2 interactions. These results could be further incorporated into diagnostics like those in the International Land Benchmarking (ILAMB) Project to provide a metric for GPP suitable for model intercomparison. In this way, results from this work will help fill a crucial knowledge gap, while also providing valuable constraints for other models.  ",

However, it is uncertain how regional hydroclimate will be affected by climate change due to the short instrumental record and the paucity of paleoclimate records from the region. We propose to utilize geochemical variations in speleothems (cave calcite deposits) collected from NE Mexico, which span the last ~60,000 years, to investigate the timing and mechanisms of past hydrologic change over a range of timescales. Speleothems are unique paleoclimate archives in that they contain multiple climate proxies, can be precisely dated with U-series methods, and can cover seasonal to orbital timescales. The isotopic and elemental composition of speleothem calcite are widely utilized as paleoclimate proxies. However, interpretation is often complicated since multiple processes, from atmospheric to within cave, can influence the geochemical signal. Through collaboration with Dr. Peter Weber, we aim to integrate our long-term speleothem stable isotope and trace element (TE) data collected at UC Irvine, with high-resolution measurements conducted with the NanoSIMS instrument at LLNL, with the goals of improving our understanding of TE incorporation in speleothem calcite, identifying annual lamina for age model constraints, and testing for proxy evidence of extreme hydrologic events, such as droughts and hurricanes. NanoSIMS will allow us to spatially map TEs in key intervals to determine if they are uniformly distributed in calcite or associated with impurities, which has implications for their use as paleo-proxies. The high resolution of SIMS will also allow us to track seasonal changes in speleothem geochemistry, which may reveal annual cycles that could be utilized for age control, as well as for seasonal resolution paleoclimate reconstruction. Finally, annual droughts and extreme precipitation events may not be captured by other analytical methods due to their fast onset and brief duration. High resolution SIMS can potentially be used to identify previously unresolved events and develop new proxies for past tropical cyclones. We will also seek to collaborate with other LLNL scientists on this project, for instance through complementary analyses via SEM/TEM/ICPMS and through seeking collaborations with the E3SM climate modeling groups.","1) Records of past climate are becoming increasingly important within the context of climate change, as they highlight the response of precipitation patterns to natural climate variability central for the development and improvement of global climate models. Here, we aim to use speleothems (cave calcite) from NE Mexico, a highly under sampled region, to produce new records of past rainfall. Speleothem sample CB4, which was actively growing when collected (modern), and is estimated to cover the last ~1200 years by U-series dating. We plan to analyze the top portion of CB4 for NanoSIMS trace element analysis at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. NanoSIMS analysis will allow us to better date the sample via annual geochemical laminae and allow for proxy calibration with historical rainfall data. 

2) CB4 was analyzed for trace metals and stable isotopes on a highly resolved spatial scale. We were able to construct an annually resolved record of past precipitation change in the region and utilize growth laminae in the sample to improve the age certainty of the sample. 

3) There were several barriers that came up during the process. Namely, the trace element concentrations were relatively low in the sample which made NanoSIMS imaging difficult to use. Although still possible to utilize this instrument, the run time had to be extended to produce high quality data. The amount of time needed for analysis was an issue for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which had many other high priority samples to analyze. To overcome this issue, we began running samples overnight. While I made the most of the time we had, instrument time was a constraint for this project. Another challenge was that the funding provided by this grant did not provide any funds to LLNL. As all employees at LLNL had to ""bill"" their 40 hours to various projects, they essentially had to work unpaid overtime if they helped me prepare samples, run the instrument, etc. There was no overcoming this issue. Lastly, covid was also a challenge. Covid restricted access to both the site and the lab for over a year for students. I attended lab meetings and even ran the NanoSIMS remotely but couldn't prep additional samples or go in to lab when the instrument needed anything to be manually altered. Covid was probably the biggest setback to the project. 

4) This grant led to the publication of two manuscripts, and a wealth of data for future researchers to develop. 

5) I have left research to work in the private sector. While I have no plans to develop this research further, data provided by this grant will continue to be evaluated and published under my PI - Prof. Kathleen Johnson."

SPEs are essential for the development of quantum encryption devices, as well as fundamental investigations into quantum mechanical phenomena. In the past decade, several different systems have shown promise as SPEs including defects in diamond, hexagonal boron nitride and several different 2D materials. In addition to the defect-based emitters, quantum dots (QDs) have shown promise as strong SPEs at low temperatures. QD emitters are considerably easier to fabricate and achieve precise placement than defect-based emitters but so far have only worked at cryogenic temperatures.  In collaboration with LLNL, we propose to investigate organo-metallic hybrid perovskite QDs as SPEs with the goal of stabilizing their emission through chemical, electromagnetic and plasmonic tuning to make a room temperature SPE. By collaborating with Dr. Ted Laurence at LLNL for his spectroscopy expertise, I hope to gain more insight into advanced time-resolved spectroscopies, such as photon correlation Fourier Spectroscopy techniques, that will measure the quality of our SPEs.   We have previously shown that we can chemically tune our QD emission characteristics by changing the ligands that functionalize their surface. In collaborating with LLNL and with Dr. Tiziana Bond, specifically for her expertise in photonic materials as well as in modeling and fabricating plasmonic structures, we hope to use plasmonic structures to increase the SPE emission and tune their spectral properties via plasmonic coupling. LLNL fabrication capabilities with electron beam lithography and gold deposition and their Transmission Electron Microscope for structure characterization will also be of great assistance.  The goal of this proposed thesis work is to make advancements in organo-metallic hybrid perovskite QD room temperature SPEs by making strides in our understanding of how to tune and manipulate these devices.","Many current and developing quantum-based technologies and experiments rely on the controlled generation of single photons. The last 10 years have seen an increase in the diversity of single-photon emitting materials; from optically active defects in Diamond, defects in 2 Dimensional materials to expertly made quantum wells. However, while coherent single-photon operation has been seen in these materials at cryogenic temperatures, room temperature operation remains incoherent.  To this end, we set out with a goal of establishing room temperature coherent single photon emitters with organic perovskite quantum dots (PQD).   The main aims of the proposal were to: 1) Establish the quality of the perovskite quantum dots as possible single photon emitters, then 2) couple the PQDs to plasmonic structures to increase optical absorption and modify the number of photons per second they output.  We successfully measured PQDs in the single dot regime with the custom built Photoluminescence (PL) / Time Resolved PL / Antibunching setup originally proposed.  The first barrier met and overcome was the discovered instability in the organic PQDs with them breaking down during the 4 month gap in research caused by the Covid 19 Pandemic.  We overcame this barrier by working closely with our collaborators at UC Santa Cruz to switch to the more stable, but less emissive inorganic PQDs until organic replacements could be found.  Unfortunately, organic replacements were only found 3 months prior to the finishing of the project due to supply chain issues engendered by the pandemic.  However this time was put to good use, further developing the capability of the setup to add spatially and thermally resolved measurement schemes, preliminary measurements on the perovskite magic clusters (sub 3 nanometer PQDs uniquely synthesized by our collaborators at UCSC) mentioned in the proposal, and my professional development at both UC Merced and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  We concluded with successful measurement PQDs in the single dot regime, with the collected data being used in future proposals for next year.  The project will continue with another graduate student in Dr. Ghosh's lab at UC Merced with an ongoing collaboration with Dr. Bond at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory."

Numerical methods, especially Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), are playing an increasingly crucial role in their investigation.  However, despite much progress, QMC remains computationally expensive; hence algorithm development remains a forefront problem in the evolution of the field. Langevin-based algorithms are key prospects for a breakthrough as they offer the possibility of improving the scaling of QMC from cubic to linear in the number of electrons. Although widely successful in lattice gauge theory (LGT), Langevin methods are less established in condensed matter physics, and have only recently been applied to simulating electron-phonon interactions.    Working with Staff Scientist Kipton Barros at LANL, UC Davis Professor Richard Scalettar’s graduate student Benjamin Cohen-Stead will build on this initial success.  The proposed research will have two broad foci.  First, Ben will work on further improving the effectiveness of Langevin methods as applied to electron-phonon systems by investigating algorithmic improvements, including  machine-learned preconditioners that reduce the number of matrix-vector multiplications needed in simulations, developing better estimators for physical observables, and using GPU units to accelerate the core linear algebra operations. Second, he will apply these newly developed Langevin methods to simulating interacting electron-phonon systems that were previously intractable, with the promise of uncovering novel emergent physics.  One key objective will be the first large-scale, low temperature calculation of the phase diagram of a model which combines electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions.  By collaborating with Kipton Barros at LANL, Ben will be able to benefit from his mentors’ complementary expertise in quantum simulations techniques, while developing dynamic codes capable of exploiting the substantial computing resources at LANL.  Both the algorithmic improvements made to the Langevin method, and the resulting simulation studies of electron-phonon systems will result in publications that are relevant to a broad community of researchers in condensed matter physics, quantum simulation, and related fields.","The principle goal of my project was to develop a novel quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for simulating electron-phonon models. Towards this end, we developed a refined hybrid QMC (HQMC) method that enables the simulation of electron-phonon models, like the Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models, with a computational cost that scales near linearly with system size. The details of this algorithm appeared in the recently published paper ""Fast and scalable quantum Monte Carlo simulations of electron-phonon models"" (Phys. Rev. E 105, 065302). Additionally, the methods introduced in the paper are publicly available in the Julia software package ElPhDynamics.jl (https://github.com/cohensbw/ElPhDynamics.git). The method outlined in the paper not only enables the simulation of larger systems then previously possible, but also allows for the simulation of electron-phonon models with parameters take directly from ab initio calculations, allowing for more direct application to real materials. Since the publication of this paper, I have graduated from UC Davis with my PhD, and have started a postdoc at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in Professor Steve Johnston's research group, where I will be guiding his graduate students in the use of this method to study a variety of electron-phonon models."

California has been a leader in identifying coastal resilience as a priority concern. Yet, advancing effective community adaptation from these pioneering approaches requires bridging between geotechnical, engineering, legal, political, economic, sociological, and anthropological perspectives to resolve context-sensitive, community problems.

This proposal would leverage multi-disciplinary expertise at UC Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, and San Diego (and collaborators) to address the need for integrated coastal resilience research and targeted policy development by improving the understanding of coastal impacts and adaptation solutions (e.g., coastal defense, managed retreat, or insurance mechanisms) from the physical, ecological, and socio-economic perspectives. Although there are nodes of activity in the UC system developing research independently in these key areas, significant potential exists for building a system-wide interdisciplinary network specifically focused on the integration of coastal science into policy and decision-making frameworks. The partnership will integrate coastal processes science with engineering/design and policy/law to provide solutions for the local adaptation challenges. This goal would serve multiple primary objectives of the California Ocean Protection Council strategic plan, and will inform solutions driven by local needs and contexts. MRPI funding would support seed projects; cultivate dialogue between students, coastal scientists, decision-makers and communities at risk; and support the next generation of policy-relevant, solutions-focused coastal resilience science and education. This partnership would include two workshops (that will include other centers beyond this Consortium) to identify how to align resources; learn about intercampus research and challenges; explore emerging methodologies; include graduate student training and research; and seek further funding for expanding cross-campus collaborations. The initial expected outcomes include (1) scholarly products; (2) extramural funding applications; (3) outreach, education and integration of information into actionable adaptation; and (4) identification of next phases of network development.","This project synthesized critical gaps in coastal adaptation knowledge and technology for California that were identified through a review of the recent literature and policy documents, two workshops (one with adaptation practitioners, and one with scientists from the University of California, UC) and detailed analysis of selected case studies. It focuses on those gaps that if addressed, might best align future research with community coastal adaptation needs. 

The pilot multicampus collaboration on coastal resilience and adaptation between three UC campuses: Santa Cruz (UCSC), Santa Barbara (UCSB) and San Diego (UCSD) has completed and publish a review report with the main outputs of the analysis, participated in conferences, and developed a storymap for public. The multicampus collaboration has also strengthened ties between the three campuses for collaboration in coastal adaptation and management solutions. The project has been completed, but the team continues to work on a review article, which we aim to submit at a special collection on sea level rise (https://www.nature.com/collections/cdhcfgcahg). 

The goal of our collaboration was to generally identify current understandings of coastal hazard impacts and adaptation strategies along California’s heterogenous coastline. While communities have made significant progress beginning to address coastal vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies, we have found out that efforts face multiple challenges going forward. These challenges run the gamut from the need to build community and organizational capacity to conduct adaptation planning, to grappling with scientific uncertainty in projections of sea level rise (SLR) but also other coastal hazards determining future coastal change, ecosystem changes and functions, to the evaluation of economics, financing, implementation, regional effects, and monitoring of adaptation strategies and pathways.

This assessment identified at least 33 key research needs and gaps that would be most actionable to advance adaptation in the State. We organized these gaps into seven overarching adaptation questions. The report also includes extended technical annexes with a review of existing data and tools relevant for coastal adaptation, policy, and guidance notes, and details of identified needs and gaps (see organization summary).

Through a participatory scenario-based approach, we use state-of-the-art computing, coupled with locally sourced knowledge, to build holistic understanding of the multifaceted tradeoffs associated with alternative nature-based, regulatory, demand-based, and engineering scenarios for salinity management while building social capital and information-sharing networks through extended public engagement and open-science technologies. Throughout, we test how the components of this approach (e.g., stakeholder workshops, technological resources) change stakeholders’ perceptions of the issues and the acceptability of potential management strategies, their trust in science, policy, and other stakeholders, and their understanding of complex scientific issues. Research outcomes include: 1) quantitative understanding of how nature-based, policy-based, and engineering strategies may function independently or in combination to mitigate future salinity challenges–with applications to other estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay, where salinity intrusion is a growing concern; 2) new understanding of how a topically-focused, participatory, scenario-based approach may promote a “just transition” in science-informed governance for resilience of large socio-ecological systems with deep histories of conflict; and 3) open cyberinfrastructure tools and enhanced social capital that lay a foundation for addressing other “wicked problems” (e.g., harmful algal blooms, species recovery) in the Bay-Delta. Training–for undergraduate and graduate students and public agency scientists–is integrated into the research program through new curricula, a Summer Institute, formal mentorship, and capstone/incubator projects.

During this period, our team was successful in reaching the progress milestones of our participatory scenario planning research process.  Specifically, major accomplishments during this review period included:
•	Extensive public outreach and engagement to increase awareness and participation in the project
•	Consultation with a road range of experts and relevant policy makers
•	Completion of approximately 50 interviews that formed the basis for the construction of future adaptation scenarios
•	Coding and analysis of the above interviews
•	Development of six climate change adaptation/salinity management scenarios based on the above interview data
•	Conducted three public workshops to receive public and expert input and review of these scenarios
•	Refined our project website and posted our project findings and reports there so that they are publicly accessible. 
•	Conducted multiple internal team workshops to refine the adaptation scenarios
•	Began applied modeling of scenarios.
One of the main challenges we have in this project is reaching and engaging marginalized and vulnerable communities who are potentially the most impacted by climate change, yet typically don’t have a voice in planning and decision making.  We continue to work on this challenge through extensive and targeted outreach efforts, which thus far, have proven successful.
Our research plan for this upcoming year will be focused on the following tasks:
•	Modeling the future adaptation scenarios across a range of criteria across our sub teams.  This will include hydrodynamic modeling (modeling of salinity and water quality), and modeling of ecological, recreational and economic impacts and benefits of each scenario.  The goal of modeling efforts is to be able to understand comparative tradoffs and benefits across the six scenarios.
•	Ongoing public outreach efforts.  Our hope is to continue to expand the public audience and public participation in this project through a robust public outreach plan
•	Host our second public workshop, in which we will share our modeling findings and solicit public input to further guide our teams future research efforts."

From the heat of supernovae to ultracold atoms and from gravitational waves to the wave function of a single photon, experiments reaching higher degrees of control of photon sources beyond previously accessible parameters have revealed fundamental facts about the universe from the smallest to the largest scales. One commonality amongst these phenomena is the necessity of well-crafted control over photonic and electronic wavepackets to either drive processes in matter or conduct (quantum) measurements and computation with unprecedented precision in both time and space at fundamental atomic scales.
 
At the intersection between photon and free electrons, intriguing physics in quantum electrodynamics (QED) presents new opportunities to upend the paradigm of X-ray science and engineering and circumvent traditional cost-accessibility tradeoffs in basic sciences, and commercial and medical applications. Emerging QED theory has revived interest in studying new X-ray production regimes, namely quantum X-ray emission, promising to unveil new quantum physical phenomena relevant in life and energy sciences, quantum computation, and metrology. Technologically, quantum X-ray emission can enable a dramatic cost reduction and portability of integrated (on-chip) X-ray sources to affect their application and upend their limited accessibility. This proposal presents two specific near-term objectives for future ultracompact and portable, high-brightness X-ray sources and novel QED photon-electron technologies: (Objective 1) a first-time demonstration of quantum X-ray emission, i.e., coherent multi-state X-ray radiation via electron waveshaping, and (Objective 2) its extension to pulsed and time-domain tailored X-ray emission via laser-based modulation of multi-state electron wavepackets. 

The quantum wave nature of electrons provides new degrees of freedom for controlling light emission via electron waveshaping and could lead to the emergence of more versatile and powerful light sources, opening the door to ultrabright and ultracompact radiation sources such as portable and mode-locked (attosecond) X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), compact (on-chip) accelerators, and QED integrated computational devices.",

Researchers generally agree that mitigating the climate crisis necessitates long-term, collective, and concerted efforts with multiple stake-holders, including researchers, teachers, students, parents, and community activists. There is also growing evidence that youth, teachers, and schools are critical to the climate change movement. However, we lack systematic research on the common components of community-engagement initiatives connected to both schools and out-of-school programs for youth that result in consequential outcomes, and how one can facilitate such collaborations among multiple stakeholders in a transformative and justice-centered way. 

This pilot project aims to generate a framework, design principles, and illustrative cases that guide UC researcher-involved community-engagement initiatives for youth that aim to promote justice. Employing a design-based research approach, we will study four community-engagement initiatives (one per campus) at the four participating UCs for two years. All four initiatives involve collaborative partnerships among researchers from multiple disciplines, K-12 teachers and students, and community members. The team will convene monthly to share their partnership activities in various local contexts, discuss successes and challenges and share research findings, to develop and refine a framework and set of design principles. The following two questions will guide our research activities: (1) What framework and principles effectively guide the design and facilitation of justice-centered community-engagement activities for youth? (2) What types of partnerships result in actionable outcomes that can effectively promote climate justice?   

This project is significant because it will produce tools useful to other researcher-community initiatives connected to education and to youth. These products will have the features of generativity and locality by attending to the diversity of initiatives in different local contexts. Also, this project will have a broad impact both nationally and globally given the many community-engagement initiatives focusing on environmental and climate change education.",

Nature provides many examples, from colonies of ants to epithelia and organoids. Moreover, synthetic biomimetic active materials, such as self-propelled colloids and dense biopolymers driven by molecular motors, are under development.  These synthetic realizations exhibit many life-like properties and enable quantitative experiments and strict tests of theory. Importantly, they are revolutionizing bioinspired design to create the next generation of responsive and adaptive technologies, wearable devices, and biologically inspired fluidic systems.

The field of active matter has grown exponentially over the past decade and promises to be of enduring technological importance, with opportunities for external center-type support. The University of California has made key hires in this area, but has not established a critical mass of faculty at any one campus.  This proposal links together three UC campuses (UCM, UCSB, UCSD)–each of which has strong research groups in this area, including some of the founders of the field–to create a synergistic hub of excellence that will make UC an international leader in active matter and provide the seed for establishing the UC Active Matter Hub as an externally funded center. The field has so far focused on studying active fluids, where active forces generate turbulent-like flows. Signature new directions of the UC Active Matter Hub will include developing techniques for controlling active flows and designing tunable active solids. Control and tunability via designed feedback are intrinsic properties of living matter, essential for technological applications and provide the physical basis for synthetic organ design. The UC Active Matter Hub will become the focus of active matter research on the West Coast through synergistic collaborations, workshops, shared educational moduli, and student exchanges, uniquely fueling the California biotech ecosystem.

The UC Active Matter Hub will train graduate and undergraduate students of diverse backgrounds (all campuses are minority-serving institutions) in this newly emerging field, augmenting and diversifying the California STEM workforce.

Their transformative potential comes with the risk of replicating an all-too-familiar problem: entrenching a particular language variety and language user, thereby raising barriers of access to services, education, and the workforce. The proposed MRPI builds upon an existing network of researchers in California to develop a solution-oriented assessment of how linguistic and neurocognitive diversity can be best incorporated into the design of LLMs for more equitable use.

LLMs are very large statistical models trained on trillions of words and implemented with many thousands more parameters than traditional models. They are capable of producing a wide variety of styles of language, including dialogues (like ChatGPT), in a convincingly human-like way. Nonetheless, training data for these models draw disproportionately on texts produced in perceived standard varieties of English, by neurotypical, monolingual speakers with high educational attainment (Cai et al, 2024). We hypothesize that responses generated by LLMs fail to address the needs of users who don't fall as squarely in those categories, in terms of both content-generation and ease of use (Dwivedi et al, 2024). Our team proposes to explore how severe the misalignment is between user background/needs and how it can be mitigated. In doing so it aims to better match the powerful new generation of AI tools with the linguistically and socially diverse population of California.
 
Our team will develop tools to assess gaps in the usability of systems built on LLMs and to minimize potential harms. The project has three primary strands: 1) experimental pilots employing psycholinguistic methods to identify gaps in user experiences with LLM content, assessing how these gaps might decrease accessibility to services, 2) four technical workshops (2 in-person, 2 virtual) introducing UC students and researchers to LLMs and the linguistic diversity of California, 3) a set of online, modular resources to expand graduate/undergraduate curricula, with datasets, scripts, and analyses, to be use in courses or training events across UC. Workshops will be collocated with the California Meeting of Psycholinguistics (started in 2017 by Co-PI Harris), inviting presenters to incorporate social science, humanistic and clinical/applied perspectives.",

At the same time, there is insufficient evidence to guide management and treatment of pregnant individuals, due to their historic exclusion from clinical trials. An alternative to the clinical trial for evidence generation is the utilization of real-world evidence (RWE), defined as evidence derived from non-trial data sources. Pregnancy-related RWE generation has traditionally been limited to single institutions, which lack sufficient sample size, or administrative databases, which lack clinical detail. As a result, the ability to advance clinical knowledge based on currently available RWE is limited, particularly when comparing variations in care and resultant outcomes among specific subpopulations.  

This pilot project will establish the University of California Obstetric Consortium On Real-world Evidence (UC OB CORE), a new collaboration of leaders and junior scholars within four UC Health (San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Irvine) medical centers who will work to advance RWE generation within pregnancy care. We will accomplish this through three primary aims. First, we plan to establish a central clinical data repository for all pregnancies and livebirths that occur within the four centers through a collaborative clinical, informatics, and data science effort that will harmonize pregnancy-related electronic health record data. Second, we will leverage these data to examine the management of diabetes in pregnancy as a use case to demonstrate the variations in care within the system and the subsequent impact on maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Third, we will host a UC OB CORE workshop that draws from the clinical expertise of academic obstetricians, technical expertise of physician informaticists, and methodological expertise of data scientists, epidemiologists, and engineers from across UC to develop a roadmap for expansion, including cross-specialty collaboration, mentorship, and career development. Successful completion of this pilot project will develop the foundation for obstetric RWE generation within UC that will ultimately improve the quality of maternal healthcare throughout California.",

The standard method for multiplying two nxn matrices requires a number of operations of cubic order in n, which takes a long time to perform for large matrices. In 1969, Volker Strassen shocked the world by discovering a way to multiply 2x2 matrices using only 7 multiplications instead of the usual 8, which led to the first sub-cubic time algorithm for multiplying square matrices of all sizes. Since then, researchers have found increasingly ingenious methods for multiplying larger matrices faster than the standard approach. However, most of these methods remain purely theoretical and not practically implementable because, unlike Strassen's, they are not based on small-size matrix multiplication. 

This project aims to supercharge the search for new, faster, easy-to-implement matrix multiplication algorithms using a three-pronged approach:

We will use powerful optimization tools such as SAT solvers to search for special tensors and their so-called `flattenings' (matrix triples) that provide the blueprint for new multiplication algorithms.

We will harness the power of artificial intelligence to guide the search for promising new tensors that enable faster multiplication.

We will utilize random walks on flip graphs - networks that encode relationships between fast matrix multiplication algorithms. Navigating these networks in clever ways can lead us to discover new, faster methods.

The faster matrix multiplication algorithms we aim to discover could dramatically accelerate computations across the sciences and technology. In an age of big data, this acceleration is becoming ever more critical. Multiplying huge matrices is a key bottleneck in machine learning, data mining, physics simulations and more.

By combining tools from computer science, artificial intelligence and pure mathematics in innovative ways, this project will break new ground in one of the grand challenges of algorithms research. It will bring the extraordinary power of the latest optimization and AI technology to attack a mathematical problem of immense practical importance. The results could be transformative, delivering matrix multiplication speedups that help usher in the next generation of computational discovery.",

However, there are several factors threatening the health and productivity of the agricultural sector. The principal challenge is the changing climate, but other factors such as availability of farmland and the growing population are also a massive challenge. In addition, agricultural research suffers from a severe lack of funding relative to perceived high-value areas such as biomedical research and health care. For instance, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a ~$48 billion budget, which primarily funds biomedical research, while the National Institutes of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) only invests ~$90 million in research grants per year.  The agricultural sector on its own is extremely important for the vibrancy of the California population, but when food security is considered, new research that could lead to improved crop yields directly impacts human health, as well. This proposal develops a multi-institutional and collaborative framework to relieve pressure on the agricultural sector by using materials science to grow plants in environments that do not require specific soil or climate conditions, essentially making plant growth ‘climate proof’. The interdisciplinary team includes a plant scientist, synthetic biologist, materials scientist and a mechanical engineer whose expertise is manufacturing. We aim to develop plant culture substrates that can be used in hydroponic or vertical farming practices that are self-fertilizing, provide resistance to pests and pathogens, and allow for precise control of nutrients and water to the growing plants. To enable this, the collaborative team will develop hydrogels (e.g. gelatin or pectin) that can serve as soil replacements. The proposed materials will incorporate symbiotic microbes that continuously produce beneficial plant hormones to program plant growth and natural defense molecules to enhance stress resistance, develop new materials that promote plant growth, and integrate the entire package into a 3D-printable hydrogel to enable root formation, water retention, and nutrient diffusion. The multi-disciplinary team can achieve these lofty goals but requires a catalytic source of funding to generate impactful data that can lead to the first UC Plant Science Nanotechnology Center.",

Many are families and youth. In cities like San Diego, up to 1000 people have landed daily, overwhelming NGOs and service providers. Once in the US, migrants’ needs intersect with enduring urban challenges, from homelessness to health disparities. The “crisis” (as dubbed by politicians like Trump and Abbott) has made immigration a key flashpoint in US politics. California, a border state that is 40% Latino and 28% foreign-born is poised to lead the way to reimagining the process of refuge.

This project brings together leading UC immigration scholars, students, and organizations across California and the US-Mexico border to 1) conduct an unprecedented, multi-sited, and multi-scalar analysis of the impacts of US treatment of asylum seekers, by and for California’s immigrants, and 2) seed a just future for migrants. Funding will support two major initiatives:

The PIs will collaborate with immigrant NGOs and UC graduate and undergraduate students to conduct interviews, participant observation, and art workshops with asylum-seeking families across California, in detention, at the US-Mexico border, and in Mexico en route to the United States. Researchers co-design the study with NGOs and service providers and work with migrants to understand their lived experiences. The study will connect California’s major regions and compare practices in California to other sites in the US and beyond. These data will provide a first-of-its kind understanding of the impacts of current US policies and enforcement practices for migrants, with a focus on youth and families. In addition, the study will identify, design, and test humane alternatives to border militarization, detention, and long-term urban limbo. 

We will build a California-wide community of scholars and practitioners reimagining and practicing just resettlement. We will offer small grants to UC faculty, graduate students, undergraduates, community organizers, and artists, to cultivate innovation and cross-sector dialogue. And, we will hold annual two-day convenings and regular workshops to bring together these groups and reimagine refuge, intellectually, artistically, and practically.",

Given the physiology of their bodies, children, in particular, are more sensitive to heat stress than adults. Exposure to heat can have negative effects on children including dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, and heat stroke, as well as adverse effects on cognitive performance. Nearly six million children are enrolled in California’s public schools. As California experiences increasing heat due to climate change, a key question is whether the state’s schools and public health officials are ready to protect children from heat effects. This project will evaluate the vulnerability of California school-aged children to extreme heat, and will work with school and public health end-users to develop action plans to mitigate this threat. 

To address this issue, we will meet several key outcomes. First, we will use multiple data sources to compile a database of observed and predicted heat exposure in public schools that will be communicated with end-users and made publicly available via a data dashboard. We will assess heat observations and projections for a sample of 9 public schools within Santa Barbara County, Orange County, and Yolo County. Second, we will assess vulnerability and adaptation to heat exposure in the sample of public schools within these counties. Using a mixed methods approach, and considering multiple metrics, we will investigate vulnerability and adaptation to heat among a sample of public schools in these counties. We will also engage in primary data collection to assess heat health literacy among families, school personnel, and public health end-users. Lastly, we will engage community end-users working in schools, and public health administrators focused on children, youth, and health, in this research. We will identify end-user needs and priorities in the areas of heat exposures, vulnerabilities, and adaptations in these counties, and will provide these end-users with the capacity to develop decision making tools and action plans to meet their needs and priorities in these areas. 

Our project will provide a model for conducting similar research in other regions of the state, eventually scaling up to include all public schools in California.",

Despite a high mortality rate of 16% in our state, translating to over 47,000 deaths, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer a beacon of hope. The COMPOSER model, developed by UC San Diego researchers and published in Nature Digital Medicine, has shown a promising 17% reduction in mortality. The COMPOSER model utilizes predictive analytics algorithms to analyze real-time data from electronic health records, assessing over 150 patient variables to detect early signs of sepsis. Its deployment in emergency departments has led to not only a reduction in mortality but also improved adherence to protocolized care. The overarching goal of this project is the statewide implementation of the COMPOSER model to enhance early sepsis prediction and improve patient outcomes across California's healthcare system, with an estimated 8,000 lives saved per year. However, as with most technologies, this potential must be balanced by identifying and mitigating possible risks for patient harm and the propagation of healthcare disparities.

Our initiative will focus on external validation of the COMPOSER AI model at UC Irvine, UCLA and their affiliated community hospitals, by 1) identifying barriers to AI model deployment, including interoperability standards, data privacy, algorithmic transparency and bias, and provider and patient trust, 2) validating the model’s performance across diverse patient cohorts and healthcare settings, and 3) implementing a privacy-preserving federated learning platform to iteratively improve model performance based on end-user feedback. This comprehensive framework for employing clinical AI solutions will engage a diverse cross section of stakeholders to foster a robust and reliable AI ecosystem that can be scaled to benefit the entire state. 

Our interdisciplinary team, comprising experts in critical care, biomedical informatics, and privacy, will address the challenges of AI deployment, including patient privacy, consent, and unbiased implementation. The ultimate goal is to foster a trustworthy AI ecosystem, establish a new standard for sepsis care in California, significantly reduce mortality rates, and decrease healthcare expenditures.",

The estimated lifetime social cost is 3.6 million per patient. Individuals affected with ASD can be challenged at work because of their difficulty to balance multitasking and focus. Additionally, challenges with communication and repetitive or inflexible behaviors often result in unemployment and isolation. 
The neurobiology of ASD remains unresolved. Animal models indicate alterations in the development, activity and plasticity of neural circuits. These processes can be studied in a human cellular context using neurons differentiated from human stem cells, including from patients. 2D neuronal cultures often oversimplify disease mechanisms and lack the complexity of organs. By contrast, brain organoids self-organize into 3D structures, represent fetal-like maturity and often more accurately model neurodevelopmental diseases. We will employ human brain organoids to study ASD mechanisms.
Hundreds of ASD mutations have been identified. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations drive disease remain unclear. Here, we will uncover molecular, cellular, and developmental phenotypes driven by ASD-related mutations using brain organoids generated from ASD patient-derived cells as well as from ASD-gene CRISPR knockout cell lines from those same patient mutations. We will uncover the disease pathways through which ASD mutations act by analyzing neuronal differentiation and development, gene expression patterns, neuron structure and function, and neuronal activity. We will establish clinical relevance of disease mechanisms by relating them to patient brain imaging and clinical data. Understanding the pathways through which these ASD mutations cause disease will uncover new drug targets that can be pursued for ASD treatment and symptom relief.
Our studies are significant because we will use patient-derived 3D disease models that represent human neurodevelopment, and we will assign clinical relevance to disease phenotypes discovered in a dish using the same patient’s imaging and clinical data. 
Our studies are impactful because the data we derive linking mutations to pathways will highlight therapeutic avenues for ASD treatment, which will increase employment of ASD individuals and lower the economic burden.",

Unrelenting water scarcity in many regions worldwide, including California and many regions in the United States, poses a formidable challenge to agriculture, which accounts for 50-90% of water use. The product of wastewater treatment plants can become an increasingly valuable nontraditional and sustainable water resource for irrigation. One important challenge is ensuring the high quality and quantity of agricultural products in light of chemical and microbial contaminants that may be present in recycled wastewater. Conventionally treated wastewater effluent contains a variety of contaminants including per-and poly-fluorinated Chemicals (PFAS), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and pathogens that are heavily impacted by human activities. These recycled water derived contaminants substantially reduces plant growth and crop yield during recycled water irrigation. This project will: (1) Develop novel water treatment technologies to degrade chemical and microbial contaminants from recycled irrigation water, and evaluate their fate and transport in crops in the water-food nexus; (2) Develop water deficit irrigation management strategies to enhance water conservation and food production; (3) Evaluate soil health and microbial ecosystem adaptation in response to recycled water irrigation; (4) Develop novel on-farm implementable management practices (i.e., targeted crop use) to minimize the transfer of contaminants to food crops after recycled water irrigation. This project involves a combination of environmental, chemical, biological and agricultural engineering and extension expertise at the University of California, Riverside, Davis, Santa Barbara, and partnership with UC Agricultural Extension Centers in Riverside and Irvine in groundbreaking research activities.

Considerable research exists on land management practices that increase farm-level climate resilience, biodiversity, and economic viability but the implementation of equitable transitions is thus far insufficient to meet California and UC climate action goals and the needs of historically underserved communities. The COAR Transitions project uses agroecology as a transdisciplinary framework to build upon decades of UC work by advancing research to enhance UC’s capacity to facilitate EATs in California through coordinated multicampus and statewide actions. The project’s four goals are: 1) mapping and understanding agroecological transitions; 2) centering equity for EATs; 3) developing community-shaped descriptions of the contextual factors governing how and why agroecological changes can happen (i.e. regionally specific theories of change), a statewide policy roadmap for EATs, and a tool for assessing progress toward EATs; and 4) facilitating coordinated institutional changes through enhanced UC undergraduate and graduate and extension education, proposals for changes to UC and state policy, and establishment of the UC EATs Consortium. These four goals form a vision for socially and ecologically accountable transitions from individual farms to regional food systems, engaging UC with local agricultural communities, diverse organizations, and state agencies to foster deep, equitable change.

Such adversities can have long-lasting mental and physical health impacts, but many people can maintain considerable resilience and thrive in the face of adversity.    Numerous UC researchers in Health Psychology, which studies how psychosocial factors influence physical health (and vice versa), are actively studying the health impact of adversity, and the psychosocial and cultural factors that contribute to resilience. The first UC Intercampus Consortium on Health Psychology meeting took place in 1983, followed by several meetings over 30 years (the last in 2003), sponsored by UC system, departmental, extramural, and individual funding. The conferences provided around 75 faculty and graduate students opportunities to network and forge new collaborations.   This proposal aims to revive the Consortium after a decade-long dormancy, with the broad goal of making UC the world leader in research on understanding, predicting, and cultivating resilience in the face of adversity. To accomplish that goal we propose three activities and associated outcomes:    1) Facilitating cross-campus faculty collaborations. MRPI funding would support seed funding for multi-campus projects that translate basic research on thriving in the face of adversity into interventions that promote resilience. Outcomes would include scholarly products (books, new measures and interventions), and extramural research funding applications. Most projects would involve collaborations outside psychology (e.g., biomedical research, sociology, public health).      2) Creating shared resources for graduate student training and research. MRPI funding would support: Annual workshops to learn emerging research methodologies and data analytic techniques; Developing shared teaching resources across campuses (e.g., a digital video lecture library); and pilot funding for cross-campus student collaborations.     3) Reviving yearly intercampus conferences as a central organizing event. The conference would focus on small-group faculty/student discussions of collaborative projects, and planning new or ongoing cross-campus collaborations.

MRPI planning grant supported four UC campuses to work together as a multi-campus research network, establishing collective goals and seed-funding programs on each campus to advance the distinct roles of artists and designers in the practice of creative-placemaking. Campuses developed research strategies unique to their proximities, forming new cultural partnerships with diverse communities in their regions. By mapping this work collectively, the four campuses established a working platform to support and amplify other UC artists/designers and the valuable role they play in UC research and public life. These programs and initiatives continue beyond the scope of the grant, despite disruption of the 2020 Pandemic that challenged all scheduling of in-person activity, requiring two extensions to complete intended goals of the planning grant.

Modern treatment of many cancers, genetic diseases, and other conditions utilize knowledge of the genetic alterations of the patient to choose pharmaceutical agents that best treat that patient: “Personalized Medicine”. Hundreds of treatments have been developed. In order to improve these treatments, researchers compare the results of different treatments for similar genetic alterations with the length of time patients remain disease free. The UC system maintains the UC Clinical Data Warehouse with over 5 million UC patients which provides the disease free period following treatment. However the genomic and genetic data is deficient.  This is because treating physicians provides genetic testing results in a form that cannot be retrieved by researchers or they only provide partial information like the name of one or more altered genes and not the DNA sequence change.  This is in part because companies that do the genetic and genomic testing do not provide reports in a computer-searchable format. In our project we will ask all major genetic testing companies used by UC physicians to provide the entire genetic testing results of all patients they have ever tested for UCI, UCSD, and UCLA. This information is to be provided in a “searchable” form. This information will be added to the UC Clinical Data Warehouse entries for the corresponding patients. Administrators and researchers with IRB approval of the UC system will then be able to determine compare treatments with the patients’ survival data for thousands of patients, will be able to determine whether results vary by campus, which treatment is best and answer many other questions.     In our pilot program we will also apply test searches to the updated database to provide a proof of principal.  If this project is successful, it will be extended to the other 3 UC medical centers, UCD, UCR, and UCSF.     The UC system is also developing the California Initiative for the Advancement of Precision Medicine. This is a large multi-investigator group that is forming public-private partnerships to bring the most modern software to medical problems. Genetic information is a common subject of analysis. The enhanced UC Data Warehouse will rectify the current defect and greatly extend the utility of the UC Clinical Data Warehouse.   ","Patient DNA often has alterations that may provide targets for therapy of cancer and inherited diseases termed here patient “genomic data”.  These alterations are often determined by commercial companies which are utilized by treating physicians or clinics within the UC medical care system and not by tests carried out by UC pathology departments owing to the specialization of the tests.  
	State Research Aims.  The specific aims are: Specific Aim1 is to collect, share, and map genomic patient test results from three UC sites and 6 providers. Each site will develop genomic data collection procedures with 2 of 6 major testing providers; share these arrangements with the other sites for them to establishment of the procedures with the other 4 providers.

Specific Aim 2 is to test the functionality of the mapped data in the Clinical Data Warehouse for genetic research queries. 
	Barriers and accomplishments.  We extended the number of cooperating UC medical center from 3 to 6, i.e a network of all UC medical centers.  Each site formed data transfer agreements with various commercial testers to obtain UC patient data which included companies such as Foundation Medicine, Tempus, and Myriad.  We cooperated with the UCWCDW to get the data into the OMOP form for inclusion in the UCWCDW.  We are working with Paul Boutros, UCLA to test the ability to for queries of how the new data correlates with patient clinical variables, i.e.,  Aim 2. Following the end of the 2 year funding period, the project has been adopted by the UCOP UC Cancer Consortium Directed by Jessica Wu for continued development, a significant badge of approval.

MEG is a non-invasive neural imaging technique that directly measures the magnetic signal due to neuronal activation with high temporal resolution and spatial localization accuracy. MEG has been routinely used in localizing seizure foci in patients with epilepsy and for pre-surgical localization of brain functions. Recently, members of our team have showed that MEG can potentially be a powerful research and diagnostic tool for autism, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The magnetic field sensors used for commercial MEG systems are based on Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUID). SQUID-based sensors have the highest combination of sensitivity and bandwidth of any sensor known, but require costly and cumbersome refrigeration for cooling to cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K). The design and materials for these sensors have not changed in nearly three decades and there has been little progress in MEG hardware. The high cost has hindered widespread use of MEG at the clinical level and there are only about 30 of these systems in the United States (two are in the UC system at UCSD and UCSF). We propose to reinvent SQUID MEG, to make it affordable, and easier to use while at the same time improving the sensitivity and resolution. Our approach uses technologies that were not available 30 years ago when SQUID development stalled. A recent breakthrough was made by members of our team in developing a new type of high temperature superconductor (HTS) SQUID by modifying the ceramic material on the nanoscale using a finely focused beam of helium ions. This results in sensors with very low magnetic flux noise. Furthermore, unlike prior HTS technologies our new technique is relatively simple, inexpensive, high yield, and scalable to wafers for large scale sensor production. The goal of our proposed development will be to optimize the sensors and to construct prototype biomedical imaging instruments. The sensors in our instruments can be placed much closer to the scalp for greater spatial resolution and sensitivity because they function at higher temperature. Additionally we will improve the ease of use and significantly reduce the costs associated with acquisition and maintenance. While our main thrust will be the brain, biomagnetic imaging of other organs such as the heart and liver will also be investigated.","The major goal of this study was to develop a next generation non invasive instrumentation to generate and study neural activities. The vision was to have an array of detectors in close proximity to the human subject in a non-invasive manner. The primary goal was to use superconducting properties that are enormously sensitive to static and dynamic magnetic fields.  In the course of this work we brought together people and their skills in the physical sciences, engineering sciences, biological sciences and health sciences to build and test the instrumentation.necessary. On the positive side we faced electrical and magnetic noise and sensitivity challenges, many of which we overcame, a few which we didn't. We have designed and modeled a most remarkable neuromorphic logic and memory structure that functions much like the brain. It has neurons and synapse and because of the designed-in disorder in the superconducting elements, it simulates what we think of as a neuromorphic brain with a large number of memory states and at a simple level it has been physically demonstrated. Several inventions ensued. It was a very effective exposure of physical sciences and engineering with the life sciences.

The virus continues up to this writing there are  multiple stages in the number of surges of this disease. As much of our work is experimental and must be performed collaboratively in laboratories and collective facilities, our work has been difficult.

Through reconsideration of the missions as both physical sites and foci of interpretation, we pursue new research that surfaces both Native and Mexican/Mexican-American voices in the history of California and the U.S. Reflecting trends in public history over the last decade, our research will foster more complex, multidimensional public engagements with difficult histories.     The controversy over the 2015 canonization of Father Junípero Serra simultaneously united and surfaced tensions between the Native and Mexican-American communities in California. Our research seeks to bridge the disciplinary divide between Native American Studies and Chicano/a Studies, and between California Studies and Mexican Studies, fomenting new narratives of California history in which everyone has a place. Because the missions represent a shared history between California and Mexico, our project will open up new avenues of collaboration with scholars, museum professionals, and preservationists in Mexico. We aim to activate the missions in concept and space -- on multiple registers at once -- for truth telling, for the exploration of their impact as cultural and religious centers for settler and immigrant communities, historically and today.     We seek to produce new knowledge, in consultation with a California Indian advisory board, by assembling interdisciplinary, collaborative humanities labs, gathering three times a year, and by funding faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates and community partner research projects. Each humanities lab is composed of 20 UC faculty researchers, graduate students, undergraduates, national and international experts, and community partners. Labs will engage in research in the field, in archives, in the missions, and surrounding communities. California’s 21 missions are an imperfect, partial, yet essential lens to access California’s various histories and engage in nuanced and frank encounters with the past, with UC scholars at the helm, producing data-driven studies.  ","The UC Multi-Campus Research Program grant, “Critical Mission Studies at California’s Crossroads,” funded at $1.28 million, and housed at UCLA’s Chicano Studies Research Center, came to a successful conclusion in December 2021. The grant was led by PI Charlene Villaseñor Black (UCLA) and co-PIs Jennifer Scheper-Hughes (UCR), Renya Ramirez (UCSC), and Ross Frank (UCSD), along with four California Indian Research Partners, Yve Chavez (UCSC), Jonathan Cordero (Cal Lutheran), Stan Rodriguez (UCSC and Kumeyaay College), and Valentin Lopez (Tribal Chair, Amah Mutsun). The grant sponsored a series of important conferences, community meetings, and publications. It established important protocols for consultation and working with California Indians, elaborated on our website (https://criticalmissionstudies.ucsd.edu/). Included among these protocols was the establishment of a large California Indian Advisory Board and the election of four California Indian Research Partners. Several important conferences were convened, including one to honor the removal of the Santa Cruz mission bell, another on the tearing down of racist monuments (such as statues of Father Serra, the founder of California’s missions), and on new research on the missions and their decorations. A publication is under contract with UC Press, a Handbook of Critical Mission Studies, edited by an editorial collective of the four PIs and four California Indian Research Partners, with contributions by numerous scholars and community members."

The project also sought to better identify how perceptions of tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure might contribute to COVID-19 risk within the Latinx community. Additionally, the project aimed to utilize garnered information and translate it into targeted messages to increase COVID-19 protective behaviors among members of the Latinx community. During the award period, investigators enrolled 316 study participants who completed a psychosocial survey on COVID-related attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors and recruited an addition 274 participants who received an abbreviated survey. In the total sample, 8.3% reported smoking cigarettes, however, 66.9% of respondents reported living with a smoker. Also, even though 56.4% agreed that smoking increases COVID-19 risks, only 17.4% are very concerned about health effects related to secondhand smoke. Additionally, Latinx respondents who reported getting the majority of their information from other community members are more ""unlikely to get the vaccine"" compared to Latinx respondents who get their news from scientific reports or the news. Moreover, those living in rural areas are more hesitant to get vaccinated compared to urban/suburban.

Based on the responses and clear need for additional research, Co-I Lopez has expended the scope of the project and has established a strong collaboration with the NIH Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) consortium, as well as leveraging support at his new institution (he was appointed as an assistant professor at Arizona State University). As a result, the current project has evolved into a larger and fully supported project that includes an interdisciplinary advisory board. The project continues with an additional wave of data collection that was deployed in Spring 2021 to include items related to COVID vaccines. Preliminary data analysis of the combined waves of data suggest that worry on COVID's impact on one's health, getting information from the news and local officials, and the belief that smoking increases COVID health risks is related to higher intentions to receive the COVID vaccine. These results are now being prepared for community dissemination, as well as to peer-reviewed outlets.

Last, in addition to community-based dissemination of findings, investigators on the current grant, as well as the CEAL consortium, collaborated to produce animated public health messages focusing on COVID-19 vaccines disseminated in May 2021 (covidlatino.org). Moreover, Dr. Lopez collaborated with Pulitzer Prize winning artist, Lalo Alcaraz, to produce and disseminate an animation depicting COVID's impact on Latinx communities.

COVID-19 affects the respiratory tract and can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. An emerging body of literature suggests that individuals who smoke or vape may be at increased risk for COVID-19 and its more serious complications. Further, risk for COVID-19 onset and severity associated with smoking or vaping could be higher among vulnerable subsets of patients disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, including racial/ethnic minorities, those with lower socio-economic status, and those with chronic health conditions. However, studies to date have been limited and research is needed to better understand the potential impact of cigarette smoking and nicotine vaping on COVID-19 risk overall and among vulnerable populations. This study uses data from >2.2 million adults from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 who received care in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC)’s large, integrated healthcare delivery system to test the hypotheses that: 1) current and former smokers and vapers have increased risk of COVID-19 onset and worse disease progression relative to never-smokers, and 2) increased risk associated with smoking or vaping is greater among health disparity populations and those with smoking-related chronic health conditions. The study will yield sorely needed, highly generalizable data to increase understanding of whether smoking and vaping are associated with increased risk of COVID-19 onset and progression. Further, by conducting hypothesis-driven analyses to identify sub-groups of smokers or vapers who may be greatest risk for COVID-19 onset and greater disease severity, results will have immediate public health and clinical implications, providing urgently needed data to inform the design of clinical interventions and aid decision making to blunt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among vulnerable populations.","This study uses data from >2.4 million adults from March 5, 2020 to December 31, 2020 who received care in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC)’s large, integrated healthcare delivery system to test the hypotheses that: 1) current and former smokers have increased risk of COVID-19 onset and worse disease progression relative to never-smokers, 2) increased risk associated with smoking is greater among health disparity populations and those with smoking-related chronic health conditions, and 3) current and former e-cigarette users have increased risk of COVID-19 onset and worse disease progression relative to never e-cigarette users.

Public opinion and patient surveys report that nearly one-third of respondents prefer not going to a medical facility and/or experience delay in care. An NCI model estimated that approximately 10,000 excess deaths from breast and colorectal cancer may occur nationally in 2020-2030 due to COVID-related delays in screening and diagnosis.

Using real-world data, the goals of this project are to understand COVID-19’s impact on (1) cancer care management, including detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer, (2) patient-reported experience, and (3) costs of cancer care. Data sources are from electronic health records and patient surveys from Sutter Health, a large healthcare system serving a racially/ethnically diverse patient population in Northern California.

For Aim 1, we will examine the patterns of care (telemedicine use and care disruption/recovery) over time following California’s shelter-in-place order and the subphases in the ongoing COVID period. For Aim 2, we will compare whether patient experience (quality of care, access to care, care coordination, and provider communication) differ across patient groups: (a) between pre-COVID and ongoing COVID periods, and (b) between in-person visits and telemedicine visits, both in the ongoing COVID period. For Aim 3, we will examine, with potential delay in care, whether more late-stage cancer cases are diagnosed in the ongoing COVID period, compared to that of the pre-COVID period. We will compare subsequent costs of care between the two periods. In all three Aims, we will examine whether these patterns and impacts of COVID-19 are different by patient characteristics, specifically across race/ethnicity and age.

This proposed project will address the impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable subpopulations: cancer patients who are at high risk and minority patients who are likely to be culturally different and/or socioeconomically disadvantaged, resulting suboptimal health outcomes and economic burden. Our project will provide value to patients, clinicians, and policymakers, and empirical evidence to inform actionable interventions targeting specific patient groups to improve cancer care, experience, and outcomes.","We examined the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients in three aims, which are unchanged from the proposal: (1) care delivery and the use of telemedicine, (2) patient experiences with in-person vs. telemedicine visits over time, and (3) cancer detection and costs of care.

We used electronic health records, patient surveys, and institutional tumor registries from a large healthcare system. Aims 1&2 included data on oncology patient visits between 01/2019-12/2021, while aim 3 was new breast and colorectal cancers diagnosed between 01/2019-03/2020. We compared total costs of care between patients diagnosed pre-pandemic and during the pandemic.

Utilization of telemedicine visits was highest in spring of 2020, representing about 40% of total oncology visits. In 2021, during the ongoing-COVID period, telemedicine continued to account for 24% of total oncology visits. While we found racial/ethnic differences in telemedicine use in the early pandemic, by the end of 2021 these rates were comparable. In contrast, patients who were older or required interpreter services continued to have lower telemedicine use through the end of 2021.

According to patient surveys, telemedicine visits were rated more highly for getting timely appointments, providers knowing the medical history, and feeling safe as a priority. However, patients with in-person visits rated their provider higher overall, were more satisfied with their provider listening to them, and the care team’s coordination with medications and medical questions. Communication, in terms of the provider explaining things, was comparable between the two visit types. Compared to pre-pandemic care experiences, patients who had visits during the pandemic reported better ratings in 6 of 7 metrics, the exception being providers knowing their medical history.

Compared to monthly averages in 2019, we saw a 15% and 23% reduction in cancer diagnoses in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Total costs of care were comparable between patients diagnosed before the pandemic and those diagnosed during the pandemic, though we did find costs varied by race/ethnicity, age, and patients needing interpreter services versus those who did not.

Given the observed reduction in cancer diagnoses in the early pandemic, future research is needed to investigate a longer-term pattern of cancer detection and impacts on health outcomes."

Experts predict that the pandemic will trigger widespread increases in mental health problems, but little data is available to test these predictions. To fill this gap, we turn to tracking internet searches on Google, where the content of a query reflects a mental health problem and their volume reflects the community prevalence. We previously found that internet searches for severe acute anxiety (“panic attack”) reached new all-time highs following the outbreak. That study was lauded for being the first to empirically assess how population mental health was potentially impacted by COVID-19 and discuss severe acute anxiety, an outcome overlooked in many opinion pieces on COVID-19’s mental health impacts. Extending that work, we will compile thousands of unique queries indicative of mental health problems, mine these trends to (Aim 1) discover the subset with the largest post-outbreak increases, thereby identifying and prioritizing the potential mental health problems impacted by COVID-19; and (Aim 2) discover the subset of queries that mirror past survey-based population prevalence of severe psychological distress (SPD) and use those queries to forecast the prevalence of SPD post COVID-19 when survey data are unavailable. Both aims represent the state-of-the-art in using searches for data driven insights (as in Aim 1) and using searches as a proxy for traditional survey-based trends (as in Aim 2). Our study will be the first application of either to mental health outcomes. To make these results actionable, we will compile the product of both aims into a website that runs live on Google search data, allowing investigators, clinicians, and policy makers to monitor population mental health in real-time and strategize resource allocation, develop policy, and provide interventions.","The goal of this study was to provide near real-time discovery of the mental health problems facing Americans and Californians in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We were unable to procure the necessary data to predict SPD in the CA population. Our model will run live on PublicHealthTrends.org allowing investigators, clinicians, and policy makers to monitor population mental health, including estimated changes in search queries, to provide more timely data that can be interpreted as a proxy of change in the population prevalence of SPD.

These issues are rooted in historic land management practices that negatively impact soil health, diminish soil carbon stores, contribute to poor air quality, and allow chemicals to leach into waterways and groundwater tables. These impacts weaken farm resiliency to the impacts of climate change and negatively affect farmworker and community health, safety and well-being. Alternately, research suggests that regenerative farming practices can reduce soil disturbance, increase soil organic matter, improve water-holding capacity, reduce petrochemical crop inputs, enhance soil biological function and microbial diversity, and support soil carbon accrual. The proposed multi-sector, multi-disciplinary project addresses these issues through applied on-farm research, remote sensing modeling technologies, and professional workforce development. Three activities are proposed:

1) The Soil Carbon Accrual Project is designed to holistically compare carbon cycling associated with the standard or conventional farming system (full tillage; herbicide; fertilizers; pesticides; no cover) to a regenerative farming system (cover crops; no-till or conservation till; crop rotations) using Eddy Covariance tower technology and soil microbiological DNA probes to quantify the impacts on soil carbon accrual, soil microbial diversity, water use efficiency, nutrient density, and economic return. 

2) The California Resiliency Index uses sustainability factors (e.g., water resources; soil quality; water use; erodibility factors; groundwater recharge value; existing land uses; wildlife habitat potential; endangered species habitat) to predict long-term resiliency for agricultural regions and suitability for diversified farming systems within the State. The model is being collaboratively developed with the Chico State Geographical Information Center. 

3) The online Technical Assistance Provider Training and Professional Certificate Program in Climate Smart/Regenerative Agriculture Practices & Implementation is designed to increase the availability of technical assistance to support rapid transition of California farms and ranches to climate-smart agricultural practices. New courses will include Carbon Farm Planning, Pollinator Habitat, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge.","The R02CM7064 California Soil Carbon Accrual Project and WorkForce Training Program achieved all its expected milestones and is on track to complete deliverables on time and on budget. The program’s three primary activities aim to deliver measurable progress towards a climate-resilient California. These include: 1) Quantifying soil carbon accrual (SCA) through on-farm research contrasting carbon and water cycling potentials in regenerative and conventional agriculture systems; 2) Expanding an open-source model (CaRI–the California-specific Agriculture Resiliency Index) to predict on-farm resilience, providing estimated impacts of farm management practices on soil health and carbon sequestration potential; 3) Providing professional workforce development in Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) through an enhanced Technical Assistance Provider (TAP) Certification Program.

To address this, we propose a community-based, kincentric approach, leveraging local networks and practices that have demonstrated successes to create a transferable, innovative, and effective model of Indigenous-led land stewardship. Reflecting both the cultural and biological diversity of southern California, the Collaborative of Native Nations for Climate Transformation and Stewardship (CNNCTS) project will build capacity and support tribal communities and provide CSU/UC students with high-impact learning and training opportunities that leverage and transform university preserves into learning laboratories and landscapes. Aligned with and addressing California climate priorities, such as California Climate Adaptation Strategy priorities, 30x30, and the California Climate Dashboard, CNNCTS will also serve to advance applied climate science. CNNCTS partners four universities and six Tribal partners, along with the Climate Science Alliance’s Tribal Working Group, a network of representatives from 20+ Tribal governments and organizations in southern California.

CNNCTS represents a paradigm shift in how climate action is visioned, led, and implemented. Our collaborative model embodies equal valuation of Indigenous and academic knowledge, advances Indigenous management practices and stewardship, and innovates shared learning opportunities for CSU/UC students and community members. The project will directly improve California’s most impacted communities, strengthening climate resilience and community health. The project will also directly link CSU/UC academic research and teaching with community-led climate action and provide students with real-world climate action training.

In the past year, we have leveraged the activities of each partner, growing the number of trainings and community events that allow for community engagement and direction in research and climate action. We have also created an environment for cross-community and -organizational collaboration, which has led to many more opportunities to advance climate action and scholarship that values all types of knowledges. We have overcome the challenges of a tight timeline and administrative processes to allocate funding to all partners who have collectively served over 800 people in the last year through workshops and trainings, site visits and project demonstrations, listening sessions, and community activities. Our partners’ efforts reached another ~8,000 people through tabling and outreach at community events such as conferences and Tribal Earth Day events. Our events and activities have focused on stewardship to increase our climate resilience in southern California through restoration, reconnection with fire, and access and indigenous led stewardship at the coast. In the coming year, we anticipate we will be able to coordinate and collaborate with more individuals and organizations, advancing climate action led by Indigenous communities through our grassroots efforts.

Climate change threatens California’s marine resources through sea level rise, ocean acidification, extreme weather events, ocean warming, and other effects. Despite the vulnerability of these resources and their importance to local communities and California as a whole (through tourism, fishing opportunities and the general benefits of a healthy marine system) fisheries of the far North Coast are patchily monitored due to lack of funding and the area’s isolated nature. Development of fisheries research and monitoring capability will provide crucial information on fish species and communities, which will lead to better-informed management of Tribal and State natural resources in the face of climate change.
    To improve the climate-resilience of far northern California fisheries, we propose to develop a working group of Tribal, university, state, and federal personnel to carry out fisheries research on species designated as priorities by the Tribes, based on the species’ cultural, ecological, and/or economic importance. These are generally high-use and/or low-information/data-limited fisheries species that inhabit oceanic coasts, estuaries and bays in Humboldt and Del Norte counties. Data will be collected analyzed to better understand topics that include population metrics (age, growth), how species use their habitats, urchin predation on kelp, and harvest impact on mussel beds.

Fish community biodiversity will also be assessed in each Tribal area using environmental DNA metabarcoding techniques. The knowledge gained will be shared among the partners, science community and general public following data sharing agreements.","The Northern California Tribal Fisheries Collaborative is a working group of four Tribes (Blue Lake Rancheria, the Cher-Ae Heights Indian Community of the Trinidad Rancheria, Pulikla Tribe of the Yurok People, and the Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation) and academic (Cal Poly Humboldt), state (California Department of Fish and Wildlife) and federal organizations (California Sea Grant, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's Southwest Fisheries Science Center). The group shares the goal of increasing the climate resiliency of fisheries identified by the Tribes as culturally and economically important. We plan to achieve this goal by increasing our understanding of these mostly data-poor species through targeted studies and monitoring. Targeted species include Chinook salmon, razor clams, bull kelp, rockfish, surfperch, red abalone, and Pacific lamprey. Tribes do the bulk of the work on this project, collecting data on their priority species, and five graduate students supported by their advisors work on questions of interest to each Tribe. The governmental agencies are resources that provide support for the project, and project coordination is run through Cal Poly Humboldt by the PI, the part-time Project Coordinator and the Coordination Intern. 
   We are now in our first season of data collection, having completed all major permitting (except for green sturgeon, pending) and achieved all major hiring goals.  Project goals are being met, except for night smelt monitoring, which is logistically intense, and which will likely be initiated in the second year of sampling. We have completed all major trainings proposed to-date and held two Knowledge Exchange Events, where the full group gets together to make connections and discuss best practices.  Five graduate students were hired and four of the five have begun collecting data. Outreach is conducted through the project website (https://tribalfisheriesresilience.humboldt.edu) and through talks, interviews, Tribal Council updates, and social media posts. 
   Obstacles to this work have included running up against the (necessarily) slower processes of permitting and hiring, and the increased admin costs borne by the Tribal partners. We plan to continue the same work into the 2025 field season but will assess the 2024 season and discuss our research priorities for 2025 at the next Knowledge Exchange Event."

These biodiverse habitats span 25% of California (CA) and serve as the foundation for the ranching economy. CA grasslands are a biodiversity hotspot and globally unique, but climate change will make it unsuitable for endemic species; so we must innovate restoration that focuses on climate resilience. Yet a key issue remains of how to optimize trade-offs in achieving immediate outcomes vs. restoring climate resilient, species-rich communities. Most restoration practices favor common and easily cultivated species, which can risk biotic homogenization; one response could be to use climate-adapted sourcing from wider areas to bolster success. We propose integrating social, field and greenhouse methods to create a Climate-smart Restoration Toolbox to assist in drought resilient plant selection and site assessment. Our project will increase access to the best available science for restoring coastal CA grassland, inform nature-based solutions, strengthen climate resiliency, and leverage existing resources from Point Blue Conservation Science, Bureau of Land Management, and multiple grassland restoration agencies. Our objectives across three projects are: 

1. Promote biodiverse restoration by initiating a CA Grassland Restoration Network for resource and seed sharing 

2. Expand trait-based restoration by creating a toolbox for climate-smart grassland restoration, including protocols for site assessment and plant selection informed by site characterizations, greenhouse studies and practitioner surveys 

3. Explore trade-offs in plant development with greenhouse drought studies using common and “uncharacterized” CA plants important for the Wiyot tribe.

End-products will be manuscripts, student training, MS theses, a toolbox for climate-smart grassland restoration and a restoration network to promote collaborations and resource sharing to foster climate resilient grasslands. Our work will culminate in an Extension Field Day to share the toolbox and restoration network. The proposal addresses priorities from the CA Climate Adaptation Strategy, 30x30 Pathways and Climate Solutions while supporting the research of two new CSU faculty, their students, and local stewards. Co-PIs will use these seed funds to leverage external proposals for NSF and USDA.","The project goals are to promote biodiverse restoration by establishing a California grassland restoration network (GRASS-Net) and to determine best practices for establishing resource and seed sharing while creating a toolbox for climate-smart grassland restoration with protocols for site and seed selection. We have made progress towards our project objectives in piloting our network, and in collecting the needed human survey, greenhouse lethal drought and field site characterization data needed to create the climate-smart restoration toolbox. Our pilot network has had several advisory meetings with end-use partners to refine our project goals, methods and develop trust, important for community-based work. We have collected seed from 20 restoration species for our greenhouse species, including uncharacterized biodiversity and culturally important species and conducted site characterization of all our field sites. Surveys indicate practitioners would participate in a state-wide network if it was easy to access with low labor contributions; they also indicate perceived risk around seed sharing related to preserving genetic diversity, and using new tools without prior testing. Our field and greenhouse work has supported the development of protocols for site field characterization and for assessing lethal drought on restoration species. We originally planned to incorporate a seed sharing program within our network but have pivoted as we discovered a need to coordinate and support existing efforts being undertaken by three large agencies with long-term institutional funding. We also experienced obstacles related to timely receipt of grant funds which have delayed our project approximately 3 months. A campus shutdown resulted in loss of some greenhouse replicates; in the fall, we plan to regrow loss replicates to conduct the anticipated measurements. At the time we will also assess how easy-to-measure traits relate to plant mortality. We will process the remaining plant and soil field samples and conduct semi-structured interviews with disparate practitioners based on their survey responses. We will have a culminating field day and pilot our restoration toolbox that synthesized all project data. PIs have submitted grants for external funding to expand future project activities and have plans to submit at least two other grants."

Approximately 26 million acres of California is farmland and CSA can sequester 25-60 tons of carbon per acre, so the rapid adoption of these practices is crucial for the state to meet its aggressive targets for natural sequestration (AB 1757). 

The agricultural community has always been at the mercy of the elements, and is now on the front lines facing climate impacts. However, in addition to climate benefits, CSA typically increases productivity and has been shown to increase economic yield by up to 78%. Thus, for an agricultural center like the Central Coast of California, CSA provides a bulwark for economic resilience in addition to climate resilience.

The Sustainable Land Initiative (SLI) is a program of the US-LT RCD in partnership with Cal Poly, to (a) help local farmers overcome impediments to the adoption of CSA practices aimed at sequestering carbon, reducing water consumption, decreasing fertilizer use/runoff, increasing economic yield, and making farms more resilient to climate change, and (b) implement precise quantitative monitoring of the effectiveness of these practices. Practices include application of biochar, cover crops, compost and use of no-till drills, keyline plows, and waterjet stingers. Impediments to be overcome include lack of strategy, funds, expertise, equipment, and labor.

There is broad consensus that CSA supports climate objectives, but also that quantification of benefits varies widely across biomes, crops, and climate zones; accurate data are crucial and in short supply. Hence, the SLI includes a monitoring phase to generate precise data on the efficacy of CSA on local agriculture and provide an economic argument for adoption.

This proposal seeks funding to launch the SLI, support regional SLI activity, and scale via other RCDs and campuses statewide.

Fundamental strategy: leverage the human capital of universities and the established community relations of the RCD to accelerate delivery of CSA-based climate solutions at scale, through a structure that respects the administrative structures of both.","Overview. 
The goal of the Sustainable Land Initiative (SLI) is to accelerate the adoption of climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices: by developing a methodology for increasing efficiency and capacity of agricultural technical assistance, as provided by Resource Conservation Districts (RCDs). SLI will also remove barriers by providing necessary equipment at almost no cost, increasing access to funding and other resources (especially for growers from underserved communities), providing scientific and economic quantification of CSA benefits, and providing educational support for transitioning growers.

Progress and accomplishments. 
We developed and launched a system for CSA plan design and implementation and successfully demonstrated that CSA project timelines (which are typically 1-3 years) can be compressed to as little as 6-8 weeks, representing an efficiency gain of 20X. In one instance, we were able to begin implementation within 7 days of the initial request. We have established research sites at 11 farms and implemented soil carbon amendment (compost and/or biochar) at 10 of them. We held a virtual conference (with over 800 attendees) with a track dedicated to CSA. We designed and built 4 biochar kilns and 4 compost spreaders and have developed a draft lease agreement. We have initiated LCA/agribusiness interviews with 8 farmers. We have submitted 5 proposals for further funding (1 declined, 1 awarded, 3 pending). We have designed educational material for the community of practice and completed production of 1 educational video (biochar). We have built a website and designed outreach materials and launched the outreach campaign.

Major challenges. 
There was a protracted prefunding delay (contract not signed until 9/29/23) followed by another extended delay getting the contract for the subaward to the RCD signed. As a consequence, only 5 research sites received carbon soil amendment before the rainy season (the rest had to wait until March). Also, most grad students had already chosen projects prior to 9/29, so only 1 grad student joined the project (4 were planned). Another challenge was that the lead soil scientist needed to take family leave (+sabbatical) during W24 and S24 quarters.

Future plans. 
We will continue with Year 2 as planned, with plans beyond that contingent upon receipt of further funding."

The project will utilize a modified version of a proven effective climate justice and community science research curriculum developed through a collaboration between Frontline Catalysts and UC Berkeley’s East Bay Academy for Young Scientists. The curriculum will be adapted and implemented to effectively address climate resiliency and California’s climate education priorities.
Youth participants will be enrolled in middle and high schools located in Oakland’s Interstate 880 corridor; an area identified by CalEPA as a disadvantaged community with a high pollution burden. Approximately 400 trained youth will serve as community researchers that identify and promote actions to improve climate resilience. Undergraduate interns with the California College Corps at CSU East Bay, UC Berkeley and San Francisco State University will support project facilitation and evaluation efforts alongside community partner staff.
Youth action research will evaluate the resiliency of existing community infrastructure, such as schools and homes. Through this community assessment, youth will identify opportunities and areas to implement energy, HVAC, and landscape improvements (e.g., drought-tolerant species that reduce urban heat and particulate matter), as well as infrastructural changes that will reduce pollution burdens and increase climate resiliency. Youth also will devise strategies for monitoring indicators of climate-related environmental degradation. Youth will share their results and ideas with residents, local governmental representatives, and education agencies at public events. They also will provide information about existing state and federal programs that subsidize energy efficiency and landscape improvements at these events.
PIs and community partners will use qualitative and quantitative assessment instruments to evaluate the impact of the project’s climate training and youth-led research activities on participant self-identification as climate leaders.

The project aims to increase awareness, understanding, confidence and ability to take action to strengthen community climate resiliency among Oakland youth ages 10 to 25. In Year 1, the project advanced these aims by developing, piloting and evaluating a curriculum that exposed youth participants to hands-on climate science and research activities as well as opportunities for taking action to improve climate resiliency at home, at school and in their communities. Capacity constraints due to administrative barriers to accessing state grant funding on the part of subrecipients remains a challenge that project partners must navigate in order to plan and implement project activities. Major accomplishments of the evaluation research conducted as part of this project included conducting 2 focus groups, collecting pre- and post- survey data from curriculum pilot participants; gathering observational data from pilot curriculum sessions, conducting one-on-one interviews with youth participants, and facilitating a pilot evaluation debrief among project partners in May 2024. Preliminary findings from this evaluation research include a nuanced understanding of climate change among participants, highlighting personal experiences with extreme weather events and pollution, and key concerns related to safety and environmental impacts in their neighborhoods. The project significantly increased participants' awareness and knowledge of climate science and environmental justice, evidenced by improved confidence in discussing climate issues, a strong interest in community engagement, and the development of strategic thinking and leadership skills for innovative climate action solutions. Plans for continuation of the research in Year 2 include tailoring evaluation activities for subsequent curriculum cycles as these are integrated into ongoing project partner youth programs as well as the continued collection and analysis of evaluation data including pre- and post- participant surveys, observational data, and one-on-one interviews with youth participants."

The statistics for are astounding. Almost 160,000 Americans and 12,000 Californians die from lung cancer each year and, within five years of diagnosis, 82% of patients pass away. The link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer is well established and almost all lung cancer cases result from tobacco use. Unfortunately, most lung cancer diagnoses are not treatable by surgery, so chemotherapy has remained the preferred method of treatment. Therefore, it is critical to provide rapid and cost-effective access to lung cancer medications. 
Vinblastine and vincristine are two frontline anti-cancer therapeutics used to treat multiple cancers, including lung cancer. The industrial production of both of these drugs still relies on isolation from their natural plant source via an expensive and source-dependent process. Thus, vinblastine and vincristine remain some of the most expensive small molecule, off-patent chemotherapeutics on the market. Vinblastine and vincristine could be affordable with an efficient method of production; however, a viable alternative has not been developed.
Toward the development of a new and efficient means to access vinblastine and vincristine, I propose to prepare secologanin and strictosidine. These compounds are Nature’s precursors to vinblastine and vincristine. It is envisioned that these studies will lay the foundation for future studies directed toward the conversion of strictosidine to vinblastine and vincristine using enzymes.   Thus, the proposed studies would represent a significant milestone toward a scalable and affordable means for the chemoenzymatic production of vinblastine and vincristine.

Once people are diagnosed with lung cancer, they have approximately 50% chance of survival within the next five years. Although there are drugs available to treat lung cancer, such as chemotherapy and target treatment, there is still a chance the treatment will not work. To develop more precise and accurate treatment options, we need to better understand genetically what is causing drug resistance. Specifically, how do cancer cells interact with other types of cells in the lung to continue growth and evade drugs? Current studies show that cancer cells interact with surrounding immune cells to turn off their functions, so specific immune cells will not attack the cancer cells. Within the suite of immune cells, some are activated when they are assisting cancer cells and dormant otherwise. There are also many more cell types surrounding the cancer cells, such as blood and connective tissue cells, that also exist in different activated states. We hypothesize that all the surrounding cells in their various states communicate with each other to assist cancer cells with growth. To test this, we obtained data containing measurements of genetic activity in each cell type surrounding the lung cancer cells on a single cell level from a publicly available database. This allows us to peek into the genetic behavior of active and dormant cells from various cell types while they were present near cancer cells. With this data, we will first develop a machine learning algorithm to predict what communication interactions are occurring between the different states of cell types in lung cancer. This will provide insight into what cell behaviors are triggered in the different cell types. Next, we will match existing US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to the interactions to suggest potential drug combinations that can be used to treat tobacco-related lung disease.  ","Smoking cigarettes or inhaling second-hand smoke is linked to 85% of lung cancer deaths. Currently, lung cancer patients only have a 50% chance of survival within the next five years due to tumor growth and metastases. One major cause of tumor growth is the ability for cancer cells to communicate with stromal and immune cells to evade detection and metastasize. We developed a computational algorithm, REMI (REgularized Microenvironment Interactome), that can map cell-cell interactions within cancer on a system-wide level to better understand how tumors grow. We used REMI to build a map of two non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) subtypes, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), using gene expression data. We then projected prognostic information onto the interactome utilizing existing databases and categorized interactions associated with good and poor survival outcomes. Interestingly, we identified a list of interactions that were found to be associated with the transitioning of good to poor outcomes. We validated one such interaction that was found to be on the leading edge of the tumor, which is crucial for inhibiting tumor growth. By targeting such interactions with drugs, we have a potentially higher likelihood of inhibiting lung cancer in smoking patients before tumor development."

Despite the relatively low incidence rate, it has the highest mortality rate among all the cancers. Of particular concern, pancreatic cancer is the only cancer with increasing mortality. Currently, only surgery remains the best chance of cure when detected early, as there are no therapies available to effectively treat this disease. To make condition even worse, even the early identified localized tumors are not operable in number of occasions. On the other end, patients who initially respond to the currently existing gold-standard chemotherapy, often develop resistance and do not respond to the treatment and die due to recurrent disease. These currently existing challenges requires the need for identification of therapeutic options that can efficiently cure this disease in advanced stage, or the development of techniques or tools that can detect this disease at a very early benign stage, along with the measures to prevent the progression of early stage disease to inoperable advanced stages. To offer one possible solution for treatment of pancreatic cancer, our lab proposes to target the “seed” of the cancer, i.e., the cancer stem cells by inhibiting proteins unique to such cells. Our lab have already identified a number of proteins that are unique to the pancreatic cancer stem cells. The outcome of our currently proposed study will reveal if targeting cancer stem cells can prevent the growth and spread of invasive pancreatic cancer to prolong the survival of the pancreatic cancer patients.","Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease that is predicted to become the second leading cause of all cancer-related deaths in United States by 2030. Currently, there is no effective early detection strategy and targeted treatment available to treat pancreatic cancers. Therefore, our work focuses on identifying and understanding novel dependencies for the treatment of this disease.

Since the start of this project, we have made remarkable progress in addressing our proposed aims, however, slower than we had planned. This is in part due to a slower than expected timeline in expanding the experimental mice colonies, and in part due to many unforeseen reagent supply issues impacted by the ongoing COVID-related pandemic. In previous reports, we had successfully shown that deletion of nuclear receptor- retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (RORg) significantly delays the initiation and growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in oncogenic Kras-induced tumor models, as well as in patient-derived tumor samples in vitro and in vivo. 

Collectively, we have successfully generated exciting pieces of evidence to support our general hypothesis that inhibition of RORg can be an effective strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancers.  In general, we have not experienced any major setbacks in our specific aims, except for some delays due to slower than anticipated animal breeding and supply-related issues with critical reagents due to the ongoing COVID19-related pandemic. This has significantly slowed the overall pace of our project has been impacted to a significant extent, and hence have not been to achieve our projected milestone. In the future, we plan to focus our study on deeply understanding the mechanism of action of RORg in the growth and maintenance of ductal adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cancer of pancreas."

A common risk factor for these two cancers is cigarette smoking, which can account for ~80% of lung and ~30% of pancreatic cancers. Although most lung and pancreatic cancers are initially responsive to therapy, these tumors eventually stop responding, allowing them to grow and spread. In order to make tumors more sensitive to therapy and for the effects of therapy to remain effective for longer, it is critical to understand the molecular pathways cancer cells use to evade the effects of therapy. 

My project focuses on a protein located on the surface of some cancer cells named lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4 (LPAR4). Lung and pancreatic cancer patients with high levels of LPAR4 show shorter survival compared with patients who have low LPAR4 levels. Interestingly, LPAR4 is only detected when the cancer cells are challenged by unfavorable growth conditions, such as poor access to nutrients or treatment with cancer therapy. Once cancer cells gain LPAR4, they become more aggressive, more likely to spread or metastasize, and they are able to ignore the effects of therapy. These findings suggest that targeting LPAR4 might represent a new way to sensitize lung and pancreatic cancers to the effects of therapy. 

The first goal of my project is to better define how LPAR4 contributes to lung and pancreatic cancer progression. To do this, I will ask how cancer cells turn on LPAR4 as a way to cope with stress, and I will investigate how they take advantage of LPAR4 to become drug resistant. My second goal is to develop and test new anti-cancer strategies targeting LPAR4 as a new way to halt tumor progression and sensitize tumor cells to the effects of therapy. By understanding the functions of LPAR4 in lung and pancreatic cancer cells, my project should identify new therapies for these two cancer types with strong links to cigarette smoking.
","We previously found that Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4 (LPAR4), one of the six LPA receptors, is particularly important because its expression is upregulated on stress-challenged pancreatic cancer cells or tumor-initiating cells in early stages. Our study suggested that LPAR4 is necessary and sufficient to drive tumor-initiating in vivo and in vitro by establishing a fibronectin-enriched pro-tumor niche. The pro-tumor niche generated by LPAR4-positive cells not only benefits themselves but also confers stress tolerance and cancer stemness to neighboring LPAR4-negative cells, and this biological process is mediated by fibronectin/integrin-mediated signaling. The above work was published in Nature Cell Biology in Jan 2023. Moving forward, I plan to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting fibronectin/integrin interactions to prevent LPAR4-induced pancreatic cancer tumor initiation and/or potential metastasis."

Focus on the QT Interval,Tobacco Related Disease Research Program,TRDRP 2019A - High Impact Pilot Award,High Impact Pilot Award,621690,2019-04-01,2023-03-31,Holly Middlekauff,hmiddlekauff@mednet.ucla.edu,"University of California, Los Angeles",,High Impact Pilot Award,Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases,"The risk of sudden death from tobacco cigarette (TC) smoking is largely independent of smoking burden, and reverts to that of a non-smoker soon after smoking cessation. These observations have led to the hypothesis that smoking-related sudden death is a direct toxic effect of constituent(s) in TC smoke, rather than a consequence of progressive coronary artery disease. Although controversial, electronic cigarettes (ECs) are perceived by many  as a safer alternative to lethal TCs. Toxic constituents in EC emissions are orders of magnitude lower than in TC smoke – that is, except for nicotine; comparable plasma nicotine levels are achievable in EC users and TC smokers.
	Mechanisms of sudden death from smoking TCs are uncertain, but TCs are known to increase adrenaline levels and to change how electrical impulses are conducted in the heart – both risk factors for ventricular arrhythmias. Importantly, in single heart cells, nicotine has been shown to directly alter the electrical impulses in a way that could potentially lead to abnormal heart rhythms.  These changes can be detected on the ECG in humans by measuring a segment called the ""QT interval."" TC smokers are reported to have prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG, indicative of abnormal electrical conduction, and a risk factor for sudden death. In studies in mice, exposure to emissions from ECs have also been reported to significantly increase the QT interval. Interestingly, in this rodent model, QT prolongation was triggered by the solvents in EC emissions,  in the absence of nicotine. It is unknown if chronic EC users, like chronic TC smokers, have abnormal electrical conduction. Further, if present, it is unknown if abnormal electrical conduction is attributable to the nicotine, or the non-nicotine constituents in EC emissions. Our central hypothesis is that EC use is associated with abnormal electrical conduction in the heart detectable on the ECG, and that this effect is mediated by the nicotine, not non-nicotine constituents in EC emissions. This hypothesis will be tested in humans using a rigorous crossover design, including ECs with nicotine and without nicotine, and the nicotine inhaler.
EC-mediated QT prolongation in humans, if present, is a potential game changer. It would be expected to significantly influence regulations of ECs, and to alter the public’s perception that ECs are harmless.","1.	Tobacco cigarette smoking is associated with increased risk for sudden death, in part due to its adverse effects on the heart’s electrical system. Electronic cigarettes are thought to be safer than tobacco cigarettes, since they contain fewer toxicants – except for one - nicotine. The overall goal of these studies is to determine if electronic cigarettes also have an adverse effect on the heart’s electrical system, and if so, if this is mediated by nicotine or non-nicotine constituents in electronic cigarettes

In a well-established animal model, we exposed pregnant dams to nicotine, and found that not only did their offspring develop asthma at a significantly greater rate compared to controls who were naïve to nicotine, but the subsequent generation of offspring were at significantly increased risk as well, despite never having been exposed to nicotine at all. These data led us to wonder whether exposure to vaping via e-cigarettes (e-cigs) might produce the same adverse health effects as well. Here we propose to address questions that naturally arise from these provocative data: Can adverse effects of nicotine delivered by e-cigs impact subsequent generations? What is the role of flavorings in e-cigs? How do e-cigs impact the epigenome of germ cells (eggs and sperm)? How does that influence the development of lung cells (which differentiate from germ cells)? Are they normal, or abnormal? Our studies will address these questions using established models and experienced collaborators.  Specifically, we propose to investigate whether vaping effects can be transmitted across generations, and determine the relative impact of inhaled nicotine and flavorings. Furthermore, we will determine the effects of vaping on germ cell viability and epigenetic memory.  Our investigation will advance the understanding of how adverse effects of vaping are transmitted to future generations, and will not just inform public policy makers, but will arm them with objective evidence as they work to protect our society and our offspring from the harmful effects of vaping. ","Despite warnings from the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies, approximately 10% of U.S. women smoke during pregnancy, resulting in at least 400,000 smoke-exposed infants/per year. Additionally, under the belief of the apparent safety of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), there has been a rapid increase in vaping among women of reproductive age. This has resulted in a marked increase in exposure of germ cells, which are the only cells that carry information from one generation to the next of the developing fetuses, to the potential harmful effects of vaping vapors. Regardless of the form of tobacco and nicotine products, these contain thousands of compounds (toxicants, carcinogens, and nicotine) that potentially play significant roles in the adverse health consequences of their users, the fetus, and even subsequent generations' progeny. Although convincing evidence supports that smoke exposure's effects on the developing lung are predominantly caused by nicotine consumed via tobacco smoke or e-cigs, the effects of added flavoring remain under explored. This is highly relevant since although the recent FDA ban on more than 55,000 flavored e-cigs is very welcoming, flavored e-cigs continue to be available and are unlikely to disappear from the US market any time soon. Using established in vitro and in vivo rodent models and the state-of-the-art techniques, in the proposed work, we are investigating the effects of nicotine and commonly used e-cig flavorings on the epigenetic regulation of germ cells, to determine the consequences on offspring pulmonary health over multiple generations. Notably, our work addresses several key questions of fundamental significance. These include, but are not limited to, can the adverse effects of nicotine, delivered by e-cigs, impact multiple generations? What is the role of flavorings in e-cigs in mediating these transgenerational effects? How do e-cigs impact the epigenetic regulation of germ cells (both eggs and sperm)? How does that influence the development of lung cells; are they normal, or abnormal? The proposed work is expected to advance fundamental understanding on how adverse effects of vaping, and, by corollary, other environmental toxicants are transmitted to future generations, which can provide objective evidence to state and federal regulatory agencies to further formulate tobacco and e-cig exposure policies."

Unfortunately, lung cancer is not usually caught at this early stage, as small tumors such as these remain asymptomatic. Because of this, the survival rate for lung cancer as a whole is bleak. I am interested in developing new ways of detecting lung cancer earlier. An ideal early detection test would be (a) easily accessed by at-risk populations; (b) inexpensive; (c) accurate at detecting the presence of cancer; (d) noninvasive. 

All of us have short fragments of free-floating DNA in our bloodstreams that is released when cells naturally die and turn over. This DNA is referred to as cell-free DNA, or cfDNA. In a person who has cancer, some fraction of the total cfDNA originates from the tumor cells. Because tumors differ from healthy cells by the presence of mutations, tumor-derived cfDNA can be detected by looking for the presence of these mutations, and my lab has excelled at using these mutations to detect cancer noninvasively. In addition to mutations, tumor cells also differ from healthy cells in the ways they control their genes, a term that can be collectively called their 'epigenome.' The cell-free DNA epigenome has not been extensively studied as a biomarker for cancer early detection, and I am interested in developing a new method that uses the epigenome and mutations together to help detect lung cancers earlier.","Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, due in large part to the late stage of diagnosis for most patients. Radiologic screening for lung cancer has demonstrated a mortality benefit but uptake among eligible patients remains low. We have been focused on developing blood-based assays to increase the number of individuals screened for lung cancer. We have specifically focused on the short fragments of DNA found in the plasma compartment of the blood, known as cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which in cancer patients contains DNA shed from the tumor itself. This circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) contains genetic and epigenetic information about the patient’s cancer. Our labs previously developed a method to identify and measure ctDNA using tumor mutations called Cancer Personalized profiling by deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq). Here, I aimed to develop a novel method that utilized cfDNA methylation instead of mutations as a biomarker for CAPP-Seq. Through a series of molecular biology optimization experiments, we successfully developed methyl-CAPP-Seq (mCAPP-Seq). We then applied this method to a cohort of 117 patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 119 healthy controls. We developed a novel bioinformatic strategy to extract features of cfDNA methylation that would allow us to detect the presence of tumor DNA. Finally, we developed a logistic regression classifier that robustly detects early-stage tumors in a stage-dependent manner, consistent with expectations from ctDNA biology. 

 In doing the work described above, we have completed the proposed research aims. For Aim 1, I proposed to develop the mCAPP-Seq method, which we did accomplish. For Aim 2, I proposed to develop a detection method for localized NSCLC using cfDNA methylation and determine the sensitivity and specificity of the assay in a cohort of cases and controls. We have accomplished this in our training cohort of over 200 cases and controls. We still plan to apply the method to a separate validation cohort of an additional 80 NSCLC cases and 80 controls. We also proposed to test the integration of methylation and mutations for NSCLC detection. We have generated the data to test this in a subset of our training cohort, and this analysis will be completed in the coming months. We did not experience any significant barriers to this work."

In 2019, it is projected that 228,150 Americans will be diagnosed and 142,670 will die from lung cancer. Smoking is the most common risk factor for lung cancer, contributing to 80%-90% of lung cancer deaths. In 2013, the U.S. Preventative Task Force began recommending lung cancer screening for people at high risk, which has resulted in an earlier stage diagnosis for many tobacco users. However, disparities in who receives screening and appropriate treatment for lung cancer have been observed across different racial/ethnic groups, among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and underserved rural populations. Favorable prognosis is highly dependent on a patient’s stage of diagnosis and receipt of proper treatment in a timely manner. California has a highly diverse population with more Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians than any other state, a combined nonwhite population that is the second highest of any state, and one of the highest poverty rates nationwide. The objective of this dissertation is to better understand the mechanisms of disparities in lung cancer patient’s receipt of proper treatment in California. Specifically, to identify factors that explain racial/ethnic disparities in receipt of proper care from three distinct domains: spatial proximity and accessibility of treatment facilities, racial composition and segregation of a patient’s neighborhood, and aspects of the patient-provider relationship within the healthcare system. Several population-based data sources will be used, including geocoded statewide cancer registry data linked with electronic health records from a large healthcare system in Northern California. The fellow will earn a Doctor of Philosophy in Epidemiology, with mentorship and planned training in geospatial analysis, minority health disparities, healthcare delivery, methods for explanation in causal inference, and use of electronic health records for observational research.","Disparities in receipt of appropriate and timely cancer treatment exist. The objective of this dissertation is to better understand the mechanisms of disparities in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient’s undertreatment and delayed treatment in California. Specifically, to identify factors that explain racial/ethnic disparities in receipt of proper care from three distinct domains: spatial proximity and accessibility of treatment facilities, racial composition and segregation of a patient’s neighborhood, and aspects of the patient-provider relationship within the healthcare system. Aim 1 has been published. The exposure is mean-centered driving and public transit times were calculated from patients’ residential block group centroid to the treatment facilities. Contrary to expected, increased travel time decreased risk of undertreatment and delayed treatment which may be partially explained by patients choosing to travel further for improved cancer care. The benefit of treatment observed with increased travel times may be a ‘Travel Time Paradox,’ and may vary across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Aim 2 has been completed and is being prepared for publication. The primary exposure of this is neighborhood racial/ethnic concordance as defined by the racial/ethnic composition of a neighborhood being predominately concordant, mixed concordant, or discordant from a patient’s race/ethnicity. We found that patients living in predominately concordant neighborhoods had the highest rate of proper treatment and timely treatment. Minority patients living in neighborhoods with high racial/ethnic concordance were at increased risk for undertreatment and delayed treatment, possibly due to poorer social and built environments, compared to Whites living in concordant neighborhoods. Aim 3 has been completed. Work on Aim 3 has been completed. We observed that patients enrolled in the online patient portal were at substantially decreased risk for undertreatment and delay, but most patients were not enrolled.

Specifically, nicotine exposure during pregnancy has lasting implications on the health and immunity of the fetus and causes increased susceptibility to diseases of the lungs and airways. Additionally, nicotine exposure during fetal development has been shown to increase inflammation and alter immune functions. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for the formation of all blood and immune cells, making them a plausible source for altered life-long immunity. I am interested in understanding how nicotine exposure during development affects HSCs and the immune cells they generate.

PNE, which occurs during a window of critical immune establishment may affect long term health via altering immune cells as they are established or their long-term function. Here, we aimed to investigate how PNE alters immune cell establishment from Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs). We found that PNE alters frequency of HSCs and their immune cell progeny in windows of development. Specifically, HSCs seems to have issues with expansion during their critical window of establishment and migration during fetal and early postnatal development. By adulthood, normal numbers of HSCs seem to reside in the adult bone marrow but there were lasting differences in mature immune cell orogeny. Additionally, we found that PNE altered hematopoietic function in secondary immune challenge models. This work lays the foundation for future investigation of long-term effects of PNE, especially important in a time when vape pens/e-cigs are increasingly popular and contain this toxic compound that affects long-term health."

However, recent studies have begun to question this assumption and provide clear evidence of its harmful effects on cell functions. Specifically, nicotine has been shown to increase the number of blood stem cells, called hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs are responsible for the daily formation of all blood and immune cells, and are essential for life.  The number of HSCs must be tightly controlled because too many can lead to cancer, and too few can cause bone marrow failure. One way this is controlled is through the HSC's ability to make more of themselves through a process called self-renewal. I am interested in understanding how HSC self-renewal is normally regulated and how exposure to nicotine affects this unique property of HSCs. Ultimately, I hope to use the new insights gained from this study to develop strategies to more effectively and precisely treat and prevent blood cancers and tobacco-related diseases.","Although nicotine use is touted as the safe alternative to conventional tobacco-cigarettes, it has been previously shown to increase the number of blood stem cells in adult mice.

Too many HSCs may lead to cancer while too few may lead to bone marrow failure. HSCs control their numbers by a process called self-renewal, and I hypothesize that nicotine affects HSC self-renewal capability. I am specifically interested in understanding how self-renewal is controlled during fetal blood development (aim 1) and how in utero nicotine exposure leads to alteration in fetal stem cells (aim 2). In the past year, I have been able to identify a gene I believe is involved in regulating self-renewal of fetal HSCs and I am in the process of confirming this candidate gene. Additionally, I have worked on generating the tools I need to test the function of my candidate gene.  Therefore, I have completed roughly half of my first aim and I have not yet started on my second aim. 

A huge barrier to performing my research has been the COVID-19 pandemic and the California wildfires that forced UC Santa Cruz to shut down research multiple times. In particular, I lost several experiments because of the fires and being evacuated from Santa Cruz. Despite these challenges, I still made considerable progress on my first aim and I remained relatively on track. I am hopeful that I will be able to complete my aim 1 in the coming year.

This technology has drastically increased the survival rates for cervical, breast, and testicular cancer patients among others. Despite these advancements, progress in our ability to treat lung cancer has remained stagnant, evidenced by a still dismal survival rate. Lung cancer is physiologically unique in that its genome is highly unstable, or in other words, it mutates its genes very quickly. Thus, it is difficult to leverage sequencing technology to pinpoint genes to therapeutically target, as mutated genes are rarely the same between patients. Moreover, while some mutated genes have been identified as recurring in small patient populations and have available therapies, patients often relapse after an initial period of remission. This is likely due to the ability of lung cancer to mutate rapidly and thus develop secondary growth and survival pathways. Therefore, it would be prudent to develop alternate strategies to target lung cancer outside of driver mutation-based therapies. Paradoxically, the rapid mutation rate that makes lung cancer hard to treat with modern drug development strategies makes it vulnerable to ‘old school’ drugs. For example, chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin have been the front-line therapy for the last 30 years. Cisplatin is genotoxic; it damages DNA in cells, and thereby kills them. Because the genome in lung cancer is unstable and thus has high levels of DNA-damage to begin with, its ability to buffer additional damage from cisplatin is impaired relative to healthy cells. However, cisplatin at therapeutic dosages still generates damage in healthy tissue, inducing side-effects such as toxicity in the kidneys. Selectively inducing DNA-damage in tumor cells by inhibiting cancer genes that prevent damage accumulation is an intriguing alternate strategy for treatment. Interestingly, a protein complex named INO80C is over-active in lung cancer, and acts to prevent DNA damage only in cancer-like conditions. We propose that inhibition of INO80C activity will selectively amplify cisplatin’s toxicity in lung cancer cells, enabling lower dosages that promote increased efficacy in killing cancer cells and decreased off-target toxicity in patients.","Past work has identified the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex as a critical component of Non-Small Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC) growth. However, it is unclear how INO80 mechanistically supports NSCLC progression. Recent work has demonstrated that INO80, along with the transcriptional regulator MOT1, prevents genotoxic head-on transcription-replication collisions (HO TRCs) in yeast, thus preserving cell viability. Furthermore, it was observed that INO80/MOT1 depletion generated DNA damage selectively in stressed conditions reminiscent of those that exist in NSCLC. However, it is unclear if INO80 inhibition can generate DNA damage selectively in NSCLC. This project sought to firstly assess if INO80 inhibition damages NSCLC tumor cell DNA but avoids
damaging healthy cell DNA, and how this is mechanistically achieved, and secondly sought to assess if
INO80 inhibition in combination with clinical stage DNA damaging agents can selectively amplify DNA
damage in NSCLC. We can report that inhibition of INO80 by siRNA robustly generates DNA damage and suppresses growth in a NSCLC model, but has benign effects in a non-cancerous lung epithelial cell line. Furthermore, we found that co-depletion of MOT1 amplified the genotoxic/cytotoxic effects of INO80 depletion in NSCLC cells. Through utilization of genomic assays, we observed that INO80 and MOT1 co-bind at the start sites of novel transcription units termed head-on transcription units (HO TUs), which form adjacent to replication initiation sites (RIS) on the NSCLC genome. HO TUs are rich in R-loop forming sequences (RLFS), suggesting their transcription could induce genotoxic HO TRCs with an emerging replisome. We find that INO80 and MOT1 co-depletion synergistically upregulates HO TU transcription, and generates DNA damage in an R-loop and replication-dependent manner, strongly suggesting that INO80 and MOT1 suppress HO TU transcription to prevent HO TRCs. Interestingly, we found no additive effect on DNA damage phenotypes between INO80 inhibition and a variety of DNA-damaging agents, including cisplatin and ATR inhibitors, suggesting that INO80 inhibition might not amplify the effectiveness of these drugs in the clinic. Unfortunately, we were unable to optimize R-loop and DNA break mapping strategies for reliable use. Our work sets the foundation for pursuit of INO80 inhibitors for potential clinical use."

By the time lung cancer is usually detected, the patient presents with a late-stage diagnosis. Thus, screening in high-risk patients (such as smokers) to detect early stage lung cancer is sorely needed.  Radiographic imaging can be used for screening, but they lack the ability to catch tumors early and do not provide any genetic information.   Liquid biopsy, an emerging clinical approach, can solve this problem by non-invasively detecting lung cancer in bodily fluids by measuring circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fragments shed by tumor cells. We have developed a technology, electric field-induced release and measurement (EFIRM) liquid biopsy (eLB) which can reliably assess ctDNA of two major subtypes of lung cancer mutations using a small volume of blood. These two major subtypes, however, only provide coverage for 15% of lung cancer subtypes.  Therefore, effort must be made to expand the number of detectable mutations and in particular, those associated with smoking such as mutations in a gene called KRAS.  The difficulty with expanding targets detectable by eLB is that it requires true clinical samples containing ctDNA from cancer patients.  Attempts to fabricate artificial ctDNA is a challenge.  A major reason is because there is limited understanding of ctDNA biology in terms of its various traits.  In this proposal we wish to achieve four objectives.  Firstly, we wish to complete development of an eLB assay for smoking-associated KRAS mutations in ctDNA and test its efficacy on clinical samples. Secondly, we wish to describe the biological characteristics of the smoking-associated KRAS ctDNA targets that are detected by eLB in patient plasma samples.  Thirdly, we wish to observe the similarity between the biology in ctDNA from clinical samples and cultured cells harboring the same smoking-associated KRAS mutations.  Finally, we wish to attempt to use this cell culture to create a surrogate KRAS ctDNA model that can be used as standardized material for ctDNA detection development.  The findings from this project will be essential for learning more about ctDNA and cancer biology and will aid in expanding EFIRM’s panel of ctDNA targets.  This will help advance a clinical liquid biopsy approach for early detection for smoking-associated lung cancer.","1.

The difficulty with expanding targets detectable by eLB is that it requires true clinical samples containing ctDNA from cancer patients. Attempts to fabricate artificial ctDNA have been challenging due to limitations in the current understanding of ctDNA biology.  The goal of this study is to examine the characteristics of authentic ctDNA in plasma of lung cancer patients with smoking associated KRAS mutations in order to possibly utilize synthetic ctDNA from laboratory cell lines.

In order to achieve such growth, cancer cells need a higher than usual amount of proteins, the building blocks of all cells and life. Normally, protein production starts with the DNA, which contains the sequences of all proteins, which is copied into mRNA which is then translated into proteins by specialized structures called ribosomes. Because this process of translation is key in producing proteins, cancer cells try to hijack the ribosome and the rest of the translational machinery in order to alter which and how much proteins are produced. One component that is hijacked by cancer is a protein called DDX3, which in its normal function untangles mRNA to allow it to be translated. Because DDX3 only untangles specific mRNA structures, it affects only a specific subset of mRNAs and hence it can promote the production of only a subset of proteins. Different cancers, including cancers related to tobacco, take advantage of DDX3 in different ways to promote the production of different proteins, based on what is more useful to each cancer type. In order to be able to treat these tumors, we need a better understanding of DDX3 and what it does in order to counteract its activity. The research outlined in this proposal will investigate what makes up this subset of mRNAs and proteins and how increasing their production contributes to the spread of cancer. First, I will make different mRNA sequences and structures to determine which ones are being untangled by DDX3. Secondly, I will use a technique called ribosome profiling to determine which proteins are produced when DDX3 increases in cells exposed to tobacco. Finally, I will grow different cancer cells in the lab that have different amounts of DDX3 in order to investigate which cancers take advantage of DDX3. We will determine if they used the proteins that are produced thanks to DDX3 to move, grow, metastasize, and/or replicate. In conclusion, once this study will be over, we will know more about one mechanism that cancer uses to grow and spread, and we will be able to develop new drugs to stop cancer from employing DDX3 in such a way.","Dysregulation of protein production is a hallmark of all cancers. While oncogenic transcriptional programs have been studied extensively, the pivotal transition from the transcriptome to the proteome is less understood. Since cancer cells require abnormally high protein synthesis in order to sustain tumor growth, studying how translational machinery is hijacked in cancer harbors great potential for understanding tumor etiology and developing targeting strategies. DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3X, which is involved in translation initiation, is found to be mutated and dysregulated in a large number of cancers, including tobacco-related like oral squamous carcinoma and lung cancer. High DDX3X expression is associated with poor prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous carcinoma, suggesting an oncogenic role. In different contexts, such as in medulloblastoma, DDX3X loss has been linked to tumor formation, exhibiting tumor suppressor qualities. Given the role of DDX3X as a translation factor, its dual valence as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor could derive from its interacting partners and genes whose translation it favors, which are highly dependent on the specific context and tumor. Additionally, different mutations in the DDX3X protein may lead to increased or decreased function, which can contribute to its conflicting behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to understand DDX3X’s molecular mechanism in translation initiation and how mutations cause tumorigenesis. The hypothesis of this proposal is that mutation of DDX3X tunes translation to drive tumor formation.  DDX3X is known to associate with translation factors and promote cap-dependent translation initiation for a subset of human genes. Previous work suggests that DDX3X does this by binding and resolving complex and structured 5’UTRs ahead of ribosome scanning and translation initiation. Which 5’UTR features need to be resolved by DDX3X are currently unknown, as is the interaction between DDX3X and the ribosome. In this proposal, I will investigated the mechanism of action of DDX3X and what confers DDX3X translation dependency to the 5’UTR of a gene. I determined that DDX3X mutations associated with cancers, such R534H decrease the production of proteins whose 5'UTRs are sensitive to DDX3X. Additionally, this process is dependent on the association of DDX3 with the ribosome. Understanding the molecular mechanism of DDX3X and how its malfunction impacts gene expression will broadly inform cancer research, including tobacco related oral and lung cancers."

The disruption of these mechanisms is often associated with the development of human diseases such as cancer. My proposal focuses on the concept that while DNA mutations can promote cancer, the accumulation of too many mutations in a cancer cell can be exploited to kill this cell. SCLC is an aggressive lung cancer, mainly caused by heavy smoking, and is driven by inactivating mutations in two key cell cycle genes, RB and p53. These mutations mostly affect the early steps of the cell cycle but are not readily ‘druggable’. Interestingly, however, drugs targeting late stages of the cell cycle progression have been recently developed. It has been proposed that disrupting these late cell cycle steps in cancer cells in which the early steps are already disrupted, may lead to catastrophic cell division and cell death. The cancer genome accumulates many mutations and if the cancer cell is unable to repair them before dividing, this may lead to cell death. Indeed, these drugs, including inhibitors of the WEE1 protein, involved in a late stage of cell division (mitosis), have shown promising results in SCLC patients; however, evidence of resistance to treatment has also already emerged from these studies.
My project aims to elucidate the mechanisms that control how cells respond to WEE1 inhibition, why they sometimes become resistant to this inhibition, and how to resensitize them with combinational treatments. In brief, I have performed unbiased genome-wide screens in SCLC cells to identify genes whose loss of function may regulate how SCLC cells respond to WEE1 inhibition. From these screens, I have already uncovered candidate genes important for WEE1 inhibition resistance and sensitivity. I will use unique tools developed in the Sage lab, including mouse models, to identify additional candidates and validate top candidate genes involved in WEE1 resistance. I will also examine the role of these candidates at the single cell level, which allows to determine how key signaling pathways respond to specific genetic mutations in single cells within heterogeneous populations. I hope that these experiments will identify novel therapeutic strategies in SCLC and other cancer types.","Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is aggressive lung cancer with limited therapeutic options. SCLC rises predominantly by smoking and is characterized by neuroendocrine features and by the near-universal inactivation of tumor suppressor genes TP53 and RB. TP53 and RB code for core cell cycle regulators and hence cell cycle inhibitors are promising avenues for treatment. WEE1 is a critical cell cycle gene and therapeutic options targeting WEE1 results in improper cell division leading to cell death. Tumors eventually become resistant to WEE1 treatment and the mechanisms of resistance are still unclear. 

I conducted large scale screens and identified GCN2 (EIF2AK4) as a mediator of the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 inhibition. Inactivation of GCN2 leads to resistance and activation leads to sensitivity. The physiological role of GCN2 is to sense low concentrations of amino acids. I found that GCN2 is activated rapidly by WEE1 inhibitors leading to prolonged stress and eventually to cell death.

1) I identified the direct activation of GCN2 by the WEE1 inhibitor.
2) I found that Raphin1 acts synergistically with the WEE1 inhibitor. This synergy results in a prolonged stress response via the activation of the GCN2 pathway, further sensitizing the cells to treatment.
3) I re-expressed GCN2 and GCN2 mutants in GCN2 inactive cells to further elucidate the role of GCN2 and the respective mutations upon WEE1i treatment.
4) We submitted a manuscript studying spatial heterogeneity with EpicMIBI to Cancer Cell (accepted). EpicMIBI uses protein barcodes to study clonal tumor evolution. With EpicMIBI we uncovered clonal growth disparities in SCLC tumors. 
My next goal is to publish the work on GCN2 described in this fellowship. A manuscript is in preparation and we plan to submit it by the end of 2022. The findings to date are solely related to TRDPR fellowship."

Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that fetal nicotine exposure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in postnatal life. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the vascular wall, an enzyme called endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) can produce nitric oxide (NO) or superoxide anion (O2•–) depending on the bioavailability of its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). If the vasculature system is undergoing BH4 deficiency, then the eNOS uncouples, and the vasculature produces much more O2•– rather than NO. Endothelial derived NO induces vaso-relaxation while, in contrast, endothelial-derived O2•– promotes vascular constriction. Thus, when eNOS is in the uncoupling stage, it can cause vascular constriction leading to the development of a hypertensive phenotype. In this proposed project, we will employ a pregnant rat model with inhaled nicotine exposure. The offspring will be kept until the adult age of 6 months post prenatal inhaled nicotine (PIN) exposure. Their blood pressures (BP), vascular wall eNOS expressions, and other factors will be determined and compared between the control and PIN exposed groups. We expect that PIN exposure will attenuate the arterial DNA methyltransferase expression level leading to reprogrammed vascular eNOS protein levels, which will result in enhanced eNOS levels in the adult offspring. This progress will lead to eNOS uncoupling that produces less NO and more superoxide anion. Once this phenomenon occurs in their vascular walls, the offspring will develop a hypertensive phenotype in their adult life. Therefore, due to the enzyme eNOS in the vascular wall being epigenetically reprogrammed by nicotine exposure, the proposed study provides novel evidence that children who are prenatally exposed to nicotine have a higher risk of developing a hypertensive phenotype later in life.  This project may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat the nicotine-mediated fetal origin of cardiovascular disease.","Prenatal exposure to nicotine, a main addictive chemical in cigarettes, can increase the risk of hypertension in offspring’s later life. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling in vascular wall have a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular disfunction, including hypertension. This project aims to explore whether chronic prenatal inhalation of nicotine aerosols alters DNA methylation level in vascular eNOS gene promoter leading to eNOS uncoupling and programming hypertensive phenotype in offspring. To test our central hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed in this project. During the finding research period, we have tested whether the uncoupled eNOS signaling plays a functional role in the development of hypertensive phenotype in adult nicotine-exposed offspring via ex vivo and in vivo function study. Our ex vivo study showed that prenatal inhaled nicotine (PIN) exposure decreased the vasodilator (Ach)-induced mesenteric arteries relaxation response in adult male offspring as compared to the saline controls. Treatment the isolated vessels with the non-specific eNOS inhibitor, L-NAME or eNOS cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), respectively, abrogated the differences of Ach-induced vasorelaxation responses between PIN exposed and saline control offspring. However, PIN exposure did not change the Ach-induced vasodilation in female offspring. Furthermore, our in vivo study demonstrated that PIN decreased Ach-induced arterial blood pressure (BP) response but increased the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II-induced BP response in adult male offspring as compared to the controls. Acute pretreatment with L-NAME enhanced Ang II-induced BP elevation in male PIN exposed offspring as compared to the controls. On the other hand, pretreatment with BH4 abrogated the Ang II-induced BP response in PIN exposed male offspring. Our present data suggest that PIN exposure sex-dependently enhances eNOS uncoupling leading to development of hypertensive phenotype in the adult  male offspring."

Cigarette smoke contains 70 carcinogens, most of which are known mutagens and capable of activating oncogenes and inactivating tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, through genetic mutations. Indeed, TP53 is frequently mutated in breast cancer and the rate of p53 mutation is much higher in smokers that that in non-smokers.  Thus, understanding the biology of p53 will help reveal the biological pathway that contributes to the pathology of breast cancer.  Nerve injury-induced protein 2 (Ninj2), a cell adhesion molecule, is induced in response to nerve injury.  Notably, Ninj2 expression is increased in breast cancer.  However, it is not clear whether Ninj2 is involved in breast cancer development.  To this end, we performed a pilot study and found that Ninj2 is activated by p53 and in turn represses p53 expression in breast cancer cells.  We also found that loss of Ninj2 inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells carrying wild-type p53 but promotes the growth of cancer cells carrying a mutant p53.  Thus, we hypothesize that the p53-Ninj2 loop plays a critical role in breast cancer development and progression.  To test this, we will determine the mechanism by which p53 and Ninj2 are mutually regulated.  We will also determine whether the p53-Ninj2 loop can explored as a therapeutic target for breast cancer carrying wild type p53.  Successful completion of this project would further our understanding of the p53 biology and most importantly, lay a foundation for development of new therapeutics for breast cancer patients.  Moreover, the research findings from this project will be presented at the First-Year Seminars or Quit Tobacco classes at UC Davis.  The P.I. will discuss with the general audience about how smoke causes cancer from a scientific point of view.  By these means, we hope that we can develop positive attitude to help smokers quit smoking and assist non-smokers to motivate other people, such as family members or friends, to quit smoking.","Cigarette smoke is considered as an important risk factor for breast cancer development and progression.

The current proposal is aimed to investigate the role of p53 and Nerve injury-induced protein 2 (Ninj2) in breast cancer. During the no-cost extension period (Year 3), we have completed all the major studies proposed in this project.  We showed that Ninj2 can be induced by p53 and forms negative feedback loop with p53 by repressing p53 mRNA translation.  Moreover, we found that mice deficient in Ninj2 are prone to chronic inflammation owing to p53-dependent activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo.  Furthermore, we showed that a Ninj2-blocking peptide is able to activate p53 as well as NLRP3 and subsequently inhibit breast cancer cell growth by eliciting pyroptosis.  Currently, two manuscripts are being written and expected to be submitted early next year.  Furthermore, we would like to note that by using the data generated from this proposal as preliminary studies, we were able to obtain an extramural RO1 funding from NCI (CA272753; Project title The Mechanism and Therapeutic Potential of Targeting the Ninjurin Pathway for Tumors Carrying Wild-Type p53)."

Unfortunately, lung cancer is very difficult to treat because it is not just one disease - it is a constellation of many distinct diseases that are caused by an array of genetic changes in the key cellular functioning of the lung cells. It has proven hard to disentangle and understand these changes because the total number of genetic changes and key genes is simply too large for standard approaches. It has also proven very hard to just glean this information from patient data alone - we desperately need scalable and faithful preclinical models.  

Here we will continue development of very promising mouse models of lung cancer, and specifically those lung cancers that are common among smokers, using the newest technologies such as barcoding and CRISPR that we named Tuba-seq. The key shortcoming of Tuba-seq now is fairly limited ability to generate sufficiently complex genotypes. Here we will use a new modification of the Tuba-seq to allow it to use CRISPR to simultaneously mutate pairs of genes, instead of just one, substantially increasing the scalability of this very promising technology and then carry out a study of how multiple key drivers of cancers interact with one another. We expect that these interactions would be complex and this would have important implications for how cancer genes are studied and how treatments are tailored to particular cancer patients.",We have made great progress on finding ways to model complex genotypes in vivo. The main unanticipated problem was the difficulty in cloning complex combinations of guides in a  scalable and precise manner. We have solved this problem and have the key experiment in progress at the moment that will directly address the key aims of this project. We have published one study in which we showed that complex genotypes that combine individual genetic mutations that are each individually thought only to increase the speed of growth of already initiated tumors can together also lead to tumor initiation. We believe that this path is what is taken by 20-30% of the so -called oncogene-negative tumors and have filed a provisional patent.

Although electronic cigarettes have been advertised as a healthier substitute to tobacco smoking, the aerosol of e-cigarettes still contains a wide range of deleterious products, such as nicotine. 

In regard to the dental health, cigarette smoking increases risks of orofacial clefts in infants, alveolar bone loss, periodontal disease, oral mucosa cancer and tooth decay. More recently research showed that among more than 1000 people, cigarette smokers were 1.7 times more likely than non-smokers to have root canal treatment (RCT) with 28 years follow up. During RCT, the dental pulp is removed, and the canal is disinfected, filled and sealed. However, there is little report on the biological changes in the dental pulp of the cigarette smokers, which leads to the increased RCT treatment. 

Dental pulp harbors a mixture of cells including dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells (DPSCs), which are critical in mediating dental pulp regeneration. The easy access and high proliferation rate also make DPSCs a valuable resource of personalized tissue regeneration in the future. Therefore, there is much value in preserving the vital dental pulp during dental treatment.

Cigarette smoking has been reported to increase the death of stem cells and suppress the regeneration of the stem cells. In this study, we will investigate whether cigarette smoke extract and one of its major deleterious substances nicotine impair the regenerative capacities of human dental pulp stem cells, and make the dental pulp more susceptible to irreversible inflammation. The ultimate goal is to help dentists make a more accurate prognosis, provide better-personalized treatment plans, and significantly reduce the socio-economic cost of dental treatment for cigarette smoking patients.
","This study investigates whether and how cigarette smoke and one of its major deleterious substances nicotine impair the regenerative capacities of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), and make the dental pulp more susceptible to irreversible inflammation. 

We have examined the acute and chronic impact of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) and nicotine on DPSCs. DPSCs were treated with various doses of CSC or nicotine. Low concentrations of CSC and of nicotine did not impair cell proliferation, but higher concentrations reduced cell proliferation. CSC and nicotine could impede DPSCs survival and migration in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the cytokine secretion expression profile was altered with CSC or nicotine treatments. In particular, secretion of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 significantly increased while TGF-β1 levels showed differential patterns between after exposure to CSC or nicotine, as shown by ELISA and validated by quantitative PCR. Nicotine treatment also increased AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Finally, CSC induced higher levels of mutagenicity than nicotine, as shown by the Ames test. These findings suggest that cigarette smoke exposure can alter the regenerative abilities of DPSCs in various ways.

The patient sample collection was impaired due to the closure of the clinic during COVID-19. Although samples from non-smoking patients were acquired, we were unable to compare the biological properties with samples from the smoking patients due to lack of patients meeting the inclusion criteria. We have revised the IRB to reduce the smoke-pack year requirement and include more potential smoking patients in the study in the future.

Two abstracts, five poster and three review articles have been published on the project. One review was accepted and one original research article is under peer review. Two pamphlets to inform patients the health risk of smoking and how to quit smoking have been created.

We will continue to investigate how smoking impact stem cell behavior in vitro and in vivo. We will continue collaborate with clinicians to collect DPSCs from smoking patients. Future studies are warranted to further characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms of smoking-mediated damage to DPSCs, which will guide the personalized stem cell treatment plan for smoking patients"

While this can be attributed to many factors, a leading reason is that lung cancer is usually diagnosed at late stages when there are limited treatment options. Personalized medicine has revolutionized lung cancer treatment because drugs can now be selected that will specifically kill cancer cells based on their genetic differences. Unfortunately, while these drugs can prolong survival for a time, tumors almost always will become resistant. My lab is interested in developing methods called liquid biopsies that use a simple blood draw to detect when a tumor develops resistance to treatment and to profile the biological mechanisms that are causing resistance. In all individuals, blood is a trash chute for molecules released by the normal death of cells throughout the body, and in cancer patients a small subset of these molecules derive from cancer cells. Here, I propose to develop a liquid biopsy method that characterizes a molecule that has been overlooked in the blood, namely cancer-derived cell-free RNA (cfRNA). I am interested in studying cfRNA because it will likely reveal types of tumor resistance that could not be detected previously. I am also interested in merging expression information from cfRNA with genetic information from cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to improve overall detection of lung cancer. Improved methods for non-invasively detecting and tracking lung cancer could have profound impacts on survival outcomes for patients with this terrible disease.","Cell-free RNA (cfRNA) analysis could allow non-invasive tumor gene expression profiling and monitoring of lung cancers. Here, we describe RARE-Seq (Random priming & Affinity capture of cell-free RNA fragments for Enrichment analysis by Sequencing), a novel cfRNA profiling platform optimized for the simultaneous noninvasive detection of tissue-derived transcripts and associated somatic mutations. In analytical validations, we find RARE-Seq to be ~50-fold more sensitive for detecting tumor-derived transcriptomes than whole transcriptome strategies, corresponding to a limit of detection of 0.05%. To explore its clinical utility, we profiled cfRNA from individuals with lung cancer and non-cancer controls (n=141). Detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expression signatures in cfRNA increased with stage, ranging from 40% in stage I to 87% in stage IV, with driver somatic mutations detectable in cfRNA from 44% of stage IV patients. Furthermore, when applied to EGFR mutant NSCLC patients who developed resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, RARE-Seq detected both histologic transformation and mutation-based resistance mechanisms. These results highlight the potential value of ultrasensitive cfRNA analysis and provide proof-of-concept for multiple potential lung cancer applications. Future work will be required to validate our findings in larger patient cohorts, as well as to explore the potential utility of RARE-Seq in additional cancer types and non-malignant conditions."

Immunotherapy is a new approach to cancer treatment that enhances the body’s immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells. T cells, a type of immune cell, play an important role in the human immune system’s ability to fight cancer and are increasingly being used in cancer immunotherapy. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered T cell therapy genetically reprograms a patient’s own T cells to specifically recognize and kill cancer cells. CAR-T cell therapy has led to dramatic clinical responses in B cell leukemia and lymphoma, and is currently under intensive investigation as a treatment for solid tumors, including lung cancer.

A new approach to improving CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors is to use human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to generate optimized immune cells in the lab. hPSCs have the capacity to self-renew in the lab, and therefore can potentially be engineered to produce hPSC-derived immune cells with enhanced activity against certain cancers, and the ability to be used in any patients as “off-the-shelf” cell therapies. Our group has developed a novel culture system called the artificial thymic organoid (ATO) system that supports the generation of functional T cells from hPSCs in the lab. In addition to T cells, however, innate immune cells, including natural killer cells, have shown promise in cancer immunotherapy, with comparable anti-tumor efficacy and less toxicity than T cells in early lab studies. By modifying the ATO system, we have engineered hPSCs with a leukemia-targeting CAR, and induced their differentiation into CAR-expressing innate immune cells. These CAR-engineered cells specifically recognized and killed leukemia cells.

The research I propose builds on these findings to use the ATO system to develop and test hPSC-derived CAR-engineered innate immune cells for the treatment of lung cancer. The goal of this project is to establish a platform to generate a novel class of “off-the-shelf” cell products for immunotherapy to treat lung cancer, but also one that can be adapted in the future for the treatment of multiple other tobacco-related cancers.","Tobacco usage is a leading contributor of the escalating rate of lung cancer incidence in California. In addition to conventional chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy, development of novel treatment is under urgent demand. Recently, immunotherapy, a novel therapy aiming to boost the body’s own immune system to fight cancer, has gained increasing interest in cancer treatment. The remarkable success in elimination of relapsed leukemia encouraged investigations to apply it in solid tumor, including lung cancer. A new aspect of cell-based immunotherapy is to seek alternative cell source like human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) to generate optimized cell products. PSCs have the potential to be engineered to produce immune cells with enhanced anti-tumor efficacy that are ready to use for any patient as universal, off-the-shelf cell products. Our group has developed a culture system called the artificial thymic organoid (ATO) system that supports generation of T cells from PSCs. The unique aspect of this project is to understand how different engineering strategies can affect the outcome of cell products and to explore the potential of utilizing alternative immune cell types (innate lymphoid cells -- ILC) in cancer treatment.

During the two-year time, we established optimal experimental conditions to generate immune cells in large scale in ATOs. We then engineered the PSC with a tumor targeting molecule known as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and tested multiple variations of the CAR and demonstrated that different structural components can affect ATO outcomes and give rise to T cells or ILCs. We extensively characterized the properties and functions of the ATO derived immune cells. In addition, we investigated the mechanisms driving T versus ILC development which enabled us to manipulate the CAR structure accordingly to achieve desirable cell types from the ATO. In summary, we have accomplished majority of the proposed aims and elaborated on more mechanistic work to facilitate broader application of this platform for treatment of different cancer types.

Cardiovascular disease and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) are the leading cause of death in United States according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), yet the underlying details are poorly understood. How smoking exactly injures endothelial cells, the inner lining of blood vessels is poorly understood and requires further exploration. Smoking related endothelial dysfunction results in production of inflammatory molecules such as thrombin, reactive oxygen species, p38 that disrupt endothelial cell–cell tight junctions causing barrier permeability and vascular leakage that contribute to CVD. Several studies have shown increased levels of thrombin (even in minutes) in chronic smokers. Moreover, other studies showed that blood from active smokers, induced reactive oxygen species production through activation of the p38MAPK protein (a protein that can relay signals to the next protein), in endothelial cells through unknown mechanisms, suggesting a link between thrombin and p38 MAPK signaling. 
Our lab extensively works on PAR1 a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), known to regulate endothelial inflammatory responses that are linked to CVD. Previously we showed that thrombin-activated PAR1 is modified by ubiquitin (another protein) and recruits two other proteins TAB2 and TAB1 to turn-ON p38-dependent endothelial barrier disruption, a hallmark of inflammation. 
We hypothesize that smoke product-induced endothelial dysfunction results in altered p38 inflammatory signaling due to dysregulation of modulators that control PAR1 ubiquitination. We propose to identify molecular mechanisms of how PAR1 gets ubiquitinated and deubiquitinated which controls the p38 ON/OFF switch. Using advanced biochemical, microscopic techniques in cells and mice model system, this proposal will reveal how smoke products modulate PAR1-p38 inflammatory signaling in endothelial cells and identify new FDA approved drug targets for therapeutic development. The long-term goal of this proposal is to identify multiple novel therapeutic protein targets for treatment of CVD and most importantly to create awareness related to tobacco induced adverse health effects.","Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of vascular disease and induced by various inflammatory mediators which signal through GPCRs pathways that are poorly understood. Thrombin induces endothelial inflammatory responses through the activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), a GPCR. The regulatory processes that control PAR1-deubiquitination and associated p38 inflammatory signaling are not known. To fill this gap in knowledge, we sought to identify PAR1-specific deubiquitinases (DUBs) that removes K63-linked ubiquitin by conducting an unbiased comprehensive genome-wide siRNA library screen targeting all 96 human DUB genes in human cultured endothelial cells using multiple PAR1 ubiquitin-dependent functional readouts. We hypothesize that a PAR1-specific DUB is essential for terminating thrombin-induced p38 inflammatory signaling and might be altered in endothelial dysfunction. In an initial screen, endothelial cells were transfected with siRNA pools targeting specific DUBs and PAR1-ubiquitin dependent responses were assessed. We specifically examined PAR1 cell surface expression, controlled by basal PAR1 ubiquitination, and thrombin-stimulated p38 activation and downstream inflammatory signaling, which is dependent on agonist-triggered PAR1 ubiquitination. In preliminary studies have identified several candidates PAR1-specific DUBs. I focused on delineating the function of CYLD, a tumor suppressor DUB with unknown function in endothelial-GPCR-p38 regulatory pathway. We could demonstrate that CYLD knockdown regulates PAR1 cell surface expression and p38 inflammatory signaling. The molecular mechanism responsible for PAR1 deubiquination and relation to controlling the spatio-temporal dynamics of pro-inflammatory signaling are being investigated using FRET biosensors, Co-IP and confocal microscopy and in vivo methods. Among different pathway components CYLD knockdown leads to increased NEDD4-2 levels suggesting cross-talk between E3 ligases and deubiquitinase enzymes. Taken together, we anticipate that these studies identify several regulators of PAR1-driven p38 endothelial inflammatory signaling."

However, before a tumor develops into cancer, it needs to acquire not just one, but a handful of mutations sequentially. Evolutionary biology is the study of how mutations arise and spread in populations. A tumor is a population of cells, and there is no debate among scientists that cancer is an evolutionary process. Cancer-causing, so called ""driver"" mutations need to spread in the tumor to evolve into cancer. It has been previously impossible to follow and measure this process of spreading driver mutations in a tumor growing inside a body. I modified a state-of-the-art experimental technique developed at Stanford University to be able to exactly do that: quantify how different cancer driver mutations can spread in a tumor. I am using a mouse lung model to initiate tumor growth using a special virus that only causes cancer in this mouse strain. I then introduce known additional cancer driver mutations in some cells within the tumors using a second virus and the CRISPR genome editing technique. I simultaneously mark the cells with a ""DNA-barcode"" which enables me to measure via DNA sequencing if the acquisition of an extra driver mutation helped the cell to divide faster and outcompete its neighbors in the tumor. The outcome of my research will have two significant clinical implications. First, by measuring the potential to expand in an established tumor, I will be cataloging mutations based on a novel ""real-life"" property. This can help to identify mutations and the genes that are most closely linked to cancer development. Second, a recent realization in cancer research is that tumors are much more heterogenous than we previously imagined. Sequencing cells from different parts of a single tumor from the same patient showed very different mutations. The problem that this genetic heterogeneity poses is that even if just 1% of those cells are resistant to the therapy chosen by the oncologist, cancer can relapse after an initial remission. My research will hopefully make a big step towards understanding how genetic heterogeneity is generated and maintained inside a tumor.","Human cancers generally contain a multitude of genetic aberrations. This poses a problem in cancer research: building a map from genotype to phenotype is paramount. However, the effects of mutations do not simply add up (a phenomenon termed genetic interaction or epistasis), to build such a map it is not sufficient to measure the effect of single mutations in the lab. We need to measure combinations of mutations, for which we need scalable methods. My project sets out to do just that, develop a scalable in vivo method to measure combinations of driver mutations and use this method to describe a combinatorial genotype-to-phenotype map in mural lung adenocarcinoma. Since my last progress report, we were able to develop algorithms to filter different artefacts from our sequencing data, therefore reliably measuring sizes of tumor of hundreds of genotypes. We used this data to identify genetic interactions between driver genes and look for general patterns in these interaction maps. A main barrier we needed to overcome was how to filter out artefacts due to template switching happening in various steps of our experimental pipeline but mainly during the PCR amplification of tumor barcode regions. By doing so and by careful analysis of our data, we were able to i) quantify and prove that our method is working sufficiently. By targeting essential genes, we could make sure that our novel method enables us to generate a basically unlimited number of double mutant genotypes in a pooled and therefore extremely scalable and high-throughput manner in vivo, whilst the barcode in our system allows us to arrive to a data-rich readout of tumor sizes from only a handful of mice. Using this method, we were able to identify specific genetic interactions between important driver genes and find general patterns in these interactions. Analysis is not final, so in the near future our plan is to wrap up data analysis, publish our manuscript first on biorxiv, then in an esteemed scientific journal and further disseminate our findings to the public."

One potential reason for this disparity is that sexual minority individuals experience greater stress due–in part–to discrimination. It is important to better understand the reasons for this disparity in order to design better treatments for sexual minority smokers who want to quit.

Another important risk factor for smoking and relapse during quit attempts is having a romantic partner who also smokes. However, most smoking cessation treatments are developed to treat the individual smoker. For example, immediate responses to stressors (such as feelings of anger or anxiety) are associated with smoking relapse in individual smokers who are trying to quit. Previous research has largely ignored the complex interpersonal dynamics that may alter stress response in smoking romantic partners, and even fewer studies have examined sexual minority couples who smoke. 

In this 35-day Ecological Momentary Assessment study we propose to address this important gap by investigating the mood and behavior of same-sex couples in which both partners smoke and are motivated to quit. Participants will complete phone surveys for 35 days on several measures that will allow us to examine the complex interplay between two types of stressors (discrimination stress and relationship stress), each partner’s mood and interpersonal behaviors, and smoking lapses and relapse during a smoking quit attempt. Specifically we will examine how discrimination and a partner’s negative interpersonal behaviors contribute to smoking relapse, and how a partner’s positive interpersonal behaviors (such as providing emotional support) can help counteract these stressful influences.

This study will provide important information for understanding interpersonal dynamics in sexual minority couples’ smoking and cessation and will lay the groundwork for development of tailored treatments for this population.","Sexual and gender minority individuals (SGM) have a higher smoking prevalence than the general population. There are several factors (such as discrimination stress) that contribute to this disparity, however there is little information regarding the influence of a smoking partner – and other interpersonal mechanisms –  in SGM couples who are interested in quitting smoking. In this study, SGM couples who smoke complete 35 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) throughout a cigarette quit attempt. Participants also complete a timeline follow-back (TLFB) assessing their smoking 3 and 6 months after their quit date. With these data, we expect to see that greater discrimination stress associated with lower rates of cessation. Additionally, interpersonal behaviors (both positive and negative) and affect linkage may impact the relationship between discrimination stress and abstinence.
As described in our previous progress report, we successfully completed our participant recruitment and enrollment goals in January 2023. Overall, n=261 individuals were enrolled into the study and completed baseline surveys assessing several barriers to smoking cessation, demographic information, and tobacco use behavior. Of these, n=185 individuals (from 89 unique dyads) completed all 5 weeks of EMA, and n=162 individuals (from 76 unique dyads completed their 3-month TLFB). 
In the past year of the award period, we completed final data collection of the 6-month TLFB for all remaining participants (final surveys were distributed and completed in September 2023; n=158 individuals). We completed cleaning and preparing data for analysis from October–December 2023 and since then we have disseminated preliminary findings through several peer-reviewed abstracts, oral presentations, and papers. As of June 2024, we have published a manuscript on cannabis and tobacco use during the smoking cessation attempt, presented a rapid response oral presentation at the March 2024 SRNT in Edinburgh, and will present three (3) posters at the June 2024 CPDD in Montreal. Additionally, we currently have 7 additional manuscripts in early preparation covering primary and secondary research questions. Over the next year, we plan to complete data analysis and submit the above in-preparation manuscripts, as well as papers and abstracts addressing the primary and secondary aims of the study."

While SCLC represents only about 15% of lung cancer cases, it is the most aggressive and fatal form of lung cancer, with only 5-10% of SCLC patients estimated to survive beyond 5 years after initial diagnosis. Because of this, a major goal of the field is to identify key genes driving SCLC growth, spread (metastasis to other parts of the body), and response to treatment. By understanding the biology behind SCLC aggressiveness, our aim is to develop novel, improved targeted therapies to help SCLC patients in the clinic.
Identifying key genes in SCLC, however, has proven very challenging. Indeed, nearly all SCLC patients are heavy smokers, and the DNA in their tumors is highly mutated from exposure to carcinogens in the tobacco smoke. This makes is difficult to distinguish gene mutations promoting cancer from non-important mutations occurring randomly due to these carcinogens. Another challenge is the lack of robust research pipeline to functionally validate which genes are important for SCLC growth. In particular, the field has developed accurate mouse models for SCLC, in which genetic manipulations in the lungs of mice can lead to the development of tumors that resemble very closely lung tumors seen in human SCLC patients. However, these mouse models can only test one candidate gene at a time in 2-3 years, which severely limits their utility for functionally validating candidate genes in SCLC.
My work aims to fill these gaps by identifying top candidate genes using computational approaches and by testing a large number of these genes for their possible cancer-promoting functions in a new type of mouse model. Briefly, my first goal is to develop new genetic models in mice where I can mutate multiple candidate genes in the lungs of mice and quantitatively assess the contribution of each gene to SCLC growth. My second goal is to interrogate how these genes hijack normal biological processes to fuel SCLC growth. These approaches will save time and money to validate candidate genes playing an important role in SCLC while providing deeper insight into how these genes enact biological changes favoring tumor growth. Our hope is that this approach will ultimately help develop new therapeutic strategies in SCLC.","Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive form of lung cancer with limited therapeutic options. To understand the genetic factors driving SCLC, my project focused on identifying top candidate drivers using computational approaches and mouse models. Specifically, I had focused on developing new genetic models in mice where multiple candidate genes could be modulated in a single organism, rather than needing to use separate mice for each gene. In addition, I examined the functional impacts of mTOR pathway, a biological pathway altered in SCLC, on SCLC progression. 
While naphthalene treatment had been used to enhance generation of SCLC tumors using lentiviral vectors in the Rb1/Trp53/Rbl2 conditional knockout (RPR2) mouse model, I was unable to recapitulate the same increase in tumor burden in the Rb1/Trp53 (RP) mouse model. Due to this barrier, I did not proceed with performing the Tuba-seq approach in the RP model as we have done in the RPR2 model.
Overall, I was able to complete the major goals of both aims: Using the newly generated mouse models, I examined the functional impact of 40 candidate drivers on SCLC development. I demonstrated that TSC1-KO-derived SCLC tumors exhibit higher mTOR activation, as evidenced by higher levels of phosphorylated S6, and greater sensitivity to AZD8055, a drug inhibiting mTOR. While I did not perform xenograft experiments as originally planned, I performed in vitro experiments demonstrating that TSC1 suppresses the growth of mouse and human SCLC cells using both knockout and overexpression approaches. This research culminated in a publication, available as an open access article on Cell Reports. Future work can further investigate the modulation of mTOR activity (specifically mTOR complex 2—mTORC2) in other human SCLC cell lines, particularly in patients exhibiting RICTOR gene amplification."

Smoking is a well-recognized risk factor for PDAC, accounting for 30% of the cases. The goal of our research is to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to the development of PDAC. Ultimately, this will lead to better prevention and treatment strategies for this cancer. 
In order to communicate with the environment, cells use receptors, which are located on the surface of the cell. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are one of the biggest family of receptors. GPCRs communicate with molecules within the cell such as the extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK), a master switch to control cell growth and survival. Due to its key role, ERK has the potential to convert healthy cells into cancerous cells. Smoking directly or indirectly activates disease-related GPCRs. On the other hand, pharmacological inhibitions of GPCRs halt the advancement of PDAC. Moreover, frequent mutations of GPCR in PDAC indicate the importance of these receptors. However, we are still missing many parts to the puzzle as we do not understand the precise mechanism and the different roles of all players.
In our early study, we found the GPCR-mediated ERK activity occurs not on the cell surface where the receptors sit, but instead at the endosomes, vesicles for the trafficking of GPCRs from the cell surface into the cell. Strikingly, blocking this spatially controlled communication reduces the expression of a key cancer-causing gene and the growth of pancreatic cancer cells. These promising data have led to a hypothesis that GPCR-mediated ERK activation initiates at the endosomes and plays an important role in PDAC development via gene expression regulation. In this study, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism of the spatially controlled GPCR-stimulated ERK signaling and determine its functional roles in PDAC development and impart of tobacco use. We will employ cutting edge fluorescence technologies to study this signaling events in living cells. Our study seeks to fill in the gap in our knowledge of the roles of GPCR signaling in cancer development, paving the road for development of new therapeutic strategies targeting PDAC.","G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest membrane receptor family and drug target protein. Due to the extreme diversity of GPCR, the receptor senses a variety of differed type of ligands including hormones, peptides, ions, odoronts, and neurotransmitters to control myriad roles in human body. Since this comprehensive role of GPCR in many different physiology, GPCR signaling is strongly implicated in many human diseases. Amongst, the smoking-related pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development is one of the most risky cancers that is highly related with GPCR signaling. The goal of our research is to develop a better mechanistic understanding of the PDAC progression for the development of prevention and treatment strategies.
Throughout the project, we successfully completed aims 1 and 2 investigating the detailed molecular mechanism of GPCR signaling for controlling cell proliferation as we planed in time table. As a consequence, we successfully published these results in high impact scientific journal, Nature. We reported the compartmentalized GPCR signaling across cell at different subcellular locations. We found that there is essentially no ERK signaling at the cell surface but at the endosomes — organelles within the cell that sort material from the surface to the internal. Moreover, we revealed that this noncanonical ERK signaling propagates into the nucleus where ERK controls the target gene expression related to cell proliferation and survival. Strikingly, the noncanonical signaling eventually controls cell proliferation. This study answered a long lasting question in GPCR field about the detailed molecular mechanism of ERK activaition by combining the information of location of signaling origin and genetic modification. Also, our result points to the critical location of drug targets by revealing the importance of endosomes for ERK activation which presents new opportunities for PDAC drug discovery since PDAC has been shown to contain errors in GPCRs, which critically contribute to PDAC development."

The five-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer is only 3%-5%.  Therefore, catching pancreatic cancer before it becomes too aggressive to treat is very important to improve patient survival rates.  In our lab, we have developed a new mouse model that has allowed us to study the early stages of pancreatic cancer development.  We have identified a previously undiscovered cell that gives rise to pancreatic cancers.  From this, we are attempting to understanding how this cell turns into pancreatic cancer and developing a vaccine to prevent it from turning into pancreatic cancer.  As cigarette smoking is a high risk factor linked to the development of pancreatic cancer, this study will provide a foundational understanding of pancreatic cancer development and a possible early interception technique for individuals with tobacco-related pancreatic cancer.","1) Pancreatic cancer is one of the top 10 most frequently occurring cancers within the United States, and it is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Furthermore, pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult human cancers to treat, as conventional therapeutic strategies are typically ineffective, with a five-year survival rate of only 3%-5%.

In our lab, we have developed a new mouse model that has allowed us to study the early stages of pancreatic cancer development. We have identified a previously undiscovered cell (referred to as a common tumor precursor cell) that gives rise to pancreatic cancers in mice. From this, we were attempting to understand how this cell turns into pancreatic cancer and to develop a vaccine to prevent it from turning into pancreatic cancer.

2-3) Over the course of 4 months (from July-Oct), we made excellent progress on Aim 2 focusing on testing the RNA vaccine.  We have experienced some technical challenges with Aim 1. Specifically, when transplanting the common tumor precursor cells into the flank of mice, no tumors developed; however, plans were made to transplant the common tumor precursor cells into the pancreas, as this would likely create the environment needed for the cells to grow.

4) Two preliminary independent experiments testing the RNA vaccine in mice suggested that the RNA vaccine targeting the immature pancreatic tumor cells blunted the growth of the transplanted tumor cells.  We used pancreatic tumor cells in these pilot experiments, as these cells are more tractable than the common tumor precursor cells.  These initial in vivo studies suggested that targeting the common tumor precursor cells with an RNA vaccine could be feasible to prevent the growth/transition of pancreatic tumor cells.

5) Unfortunately, I was unable to continue work on the TRDRP fellowship project, as my mentor, Tannishtha Reya, accepted a position at Columbia University.  As of November 1st, I started working at an industry job, on account of the Reya lab moving to New York."

Adolescents who are low-SES are almost twice as likely to smoke cigarettes or vape as those who are high-SES. Adolescents who are low-SES may use tobacco because of the stress related to perceiving discrimination based on their SES. Extant research, which has focused on adults, has shown positive associations between perceived discrimination based on SES and smoking prevalence. However, there is a large gap in our knowledge about the association between perceived discrimination based on SES and tobacco use in adolescents. Perceived discrimination based on SES is hypothesized to be multidimensional: Forms may be overt (harassment) and subtle (microaggressions). Targets may be adolescents (direct), their friends or family (indirect). Sources may include peers, school personnel, and adults in the community. The proposed research will be the first to examine the associations between perceived discrimination based on SES and tobacco use in adolescents. Preliminary data will be collected over a two-year period from adolescents, parents, and teachers in two public high schools that include a broad range of SES. The PI has a long-standing partnership with the high schools that spans many years. The research will include interviews and surveys. Findings will provide knowledge about perceived discrimination based on SES, which will inform intervention efforts that target perceived discrimination based on SES in order to reduce or prevent tobacco use in priority populations, including adolescents and low-SES groups. Community engagement will draw from the long-term partnerships between Dr. Mello and the high schools. Public presentations will be provided about the relationships between the social determinants of health (discrimination) and tobacco use at the 2 high schools and a community. Trainees from underrepresented backgrounds will be included and mentored. A lay brochure will be created and widely distributed.","1. Brief overview of the project: The overall aim of the project is to examine how discrimination based on socioeconomic status (SES) among adolescents is associated with tobacco use and co-use. The work includes identifying the sources (peers, teachers, and adults in the community) of discrimination based on SES. The study will also determine if there are subgroups of adolescents who experience distinct patterns of discrimination based on SES and how these subgroups are associated with tobacco use and co-use.

2. Progress toward the completion of stated research aims: Progress included nurturing our relationships with the high school principals and school community. By analyzing interview data  with adolescents, we have generated a preliminary scale for measuring discrimination based on SES for adolescents. This scale was included as a measure in our survey study that included 1,558 adolescents from Albany and Richmond high schools. This work will advance our knowledge about the association between tobacco use and discrimination based on SES. All study protocols were finalized and approved by the PI’s Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research. 

3. Barriers that were overcome: The project did not experience any barriers.

4. Major accomplishments: Cultivated relationships with the school and the school community; collected survey data from 1,558 adolescents; provided 3 presentations on the project at professional meetings; developed 2 manuscripts that examine discrimination based on SES and tobacco use; developed and implemented an educational workshop on gender for 250 high school students at Richmond High School; presented an overview of the project to 80 staff members and teachers at Albany and Richmond High School.

5. Plans: Future project plans include analyzing the quantitative data from 1,558 adolescents, and to examine its associations with tobacco use. Plans include conducting multiple presentations with the community to facilitate share the study findings, including Albany and Richmond High School and a local community organization (Yes!

While the overwhelming majority of research on brain repair is centered on neurons, an increasing body of evidence suggests that vessels play a fundamental role in guiding repair and functional recovery. Identifying the mechanisms that hinder vessel formation in the injured brain is a critical step to developing therapies  that efficiently help stroke patients recover after stroke. Among all stroke patients, heavy smokers present larger brain lesions, aggravated neurological deficit, and delayed recovery compared with non-smokers stroke patients, suggesting that cigarette smoking impairs their innate ability to recover. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, one in 14 women who gives birth in the United States smokes cigarettes during pregnancy. In this study, we propose to explore the impact of nicotine, the principal constituent of both combustible and e-cigarettes, on the infants born from mothers who smoke during pregnancy. In particular, we are interested in evaluating the impact of nicotine on the infants' brain vessels.","This study aims at investigating the effect of maternal smoking/vaping on the offspring’s brain development. In particular, we are interested in evaluating the effect of prenatal exposure to nicotine on the development of the child’s brain vasculature, as these findings may provide key information on the child’s future vulnerability to cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke. In order to test the hypothesis that perinatal exposure to nicotine impairs the formation of a normal brain vasculature and exposes the child to higher risks for stroke, we used a well-established model of maternal smoking/vaping in which pregnant female rats are subjected to daily exposure to nicotine throughout the gestation and lactation periods. In addition, a 3rd animal group was subjected to a concomitant treatment of nicotine with rosiglitazone (RGZ), an agonist of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor- (PPAR-) previously studied for its ability to reverse the effects of maternal smoking/vaping on nicotine-induced asthma in the offspring. Immediately after the lactation period, postnatal day (PND) 21 offspring (F1 generation) of both sexes were subjected to a non-invasive technique of laser doppler to visualize and measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF). We found that while nicotine didn’t affect the CBF in male pups, it is associated with a significant reduction in CBF in nicotine-exposed females. In addition, we found that exposure to nicotine significantly reduced the vascular integrity in F1 offspring while reducing the vascular density in F1 and F3 offspring. Our findings reveal that the impact of perinatal nicotine exposure is sex specific as it impairs blood circulation in female and not male F1 offspring, and that the effects on cerebrovascular density can be transmitted to offspring of the 3rd generation. In order to overcome the technical difficulties associated with the small size of young rodent’s brain and cerebrovasculature, our team put significant efforts to build a Doppler laser protocol specifically designed to visualize and measure the microcirculation in young rodent brains. Future plans include evaluating the effect of perinatal nicotine exposure on the blood-brain barrier integrity and vascular leakage, as well as its long-term effects vulnerability to stroke and abilities to recover from the brain injury in the adult offspring."

A large body of literature suggests that Black individuals' smoking motives may be related to coping with psychological distress and difficulties stemming from their experiences with racism and racial trauma, as a means to self-mediate out of painful emotions. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recent anti-Black racial tragedies and violence across the U.S., there is emerging public health concern that this substance-related coping may be further exacerbated. Given that smoking is related to a host of long term health risks, exposure to racism, especially within the COVID-19 era, continues to be a serious social determinant that disproportionately increases risk of smoking among Black emerging adults and their long term health disparities. Innovation: Our proposed study aims to expand the current understanding of racism-related tobacco product use among Black emerging adults by focusing on online racism. Growing research suggests that young people of color are more exposed to racism online than in offline settings given the ubiquity of online interactions in their daily lives. They also encounter racism more conveniently and frequently on the internet, including online racial victimization and vicarious exposure to racist contents on systemic racism and race-related hate crimes. These traumatic exposure to online racism has been found to be linked to a host of mental health issues and substance use risk. Controlling for offline racism, our preliminary cross-sectional data shows that online racism was significantly associated with more recent tobacco use (e.g., earlier today) and vaping use among Black emerging adults and these links were mediated by depression and anxiety associated with online racism. Accordingly, it is imperative to explore the tobacco product use risk associated with online racism and examine potential mechanisms using a longitudinal design to identify factors that can be addressed to mitigate early tobacco product use in this vulnerable group. We propose an exploratory-longitudinal sequential design in two phases to understand the relationship between online racism and tobacco product use among Black emerging adults and to identify modifiable mediators and moderators for intervention development.","Brief overview: This project aims to examine how online racism-related psychological costs can motivate Black emerging adults to use tobacco products in California. Year 1 aims include an initial cross-sectional data-based examination of how online racism may be associated with greater tobacco product use. In doing so, the model examines whether online racism would increase online racism-related rumination and vigilance, which can in turn increase motivation to cope with this stress through smoking.
Progress: In nearing the end of the year 1 period and our target focus on the research aim I, we have successfully launched the study and collected cross-sectional data on the study variables from about 400 Black emerging adults in California. We have started to analyze the data to examine the associations hypothesized for future presentations and manuscript submissions.
Barriers: We faced a substantial barrier with this project at UCLA due to the academic workers' strike that started in the fall of 2022 and ended in the winter of 2023. The Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) that was hired as project coordinator could not work on the project during this time. Hence, the project was halted during this time and had to be resumed once the strike ended and the negotiation was settled. The budget for GSR salary also had to be increased beyond what was budgeted in year 1. However, we were able to quickly adapt to this situation and still meet the major goals in Year 1/Aim 1.
Major accomplishments: The major accomplishments are (1) submission and approval of the IRB, (2) hiring of the GSR, (3) development of data collection survey, (4) recruitment of ~400 Black emerging adults in California, (5) initiation of data analysis and manuscript preparation.
Plans for continuation: As the PI is leaving UCLA, the grant will not be continued for years 2 and 3. The PI will be continuing with work to submit the year 1 findings in a peer-reviewed journal and presentations at academic conferences. Credit to TRDRP will be given to all products."

African American/Black mothers, Native American, and White mothers tend to have higher rates of smoking during pregnancy than Asian, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander mothers. The goal of our study from Loma Linda University Health (LLUH) is to develop a tobacco cessation program that expands the outreach to these mothers by introducing the novel component of adding home visits by community health workers who are working together with the doctors providing prenatal care. During 2012-2019, LLUH ran the state-funded Comprehensive Tobacco Treatment Program – the largest maternal tobacco cessation program in the county that, in 2021, transitioned to an LLUH-affiliated federally qualified health center. Our evaluation of the real-world effectiveness of the program identified a high dropout rate by rurality, low income, and ethnicity. Our study will design and test a new program that adds eight home visits by community health workers to provide tobacco cessation support services to pregnant smokers before and after the quit date set with their doctor. Under the new program, the home visit by a community health worker will engage the pregnant mother and her household to help her quit smoking to improve her health and the health of the baby. Data from mothers, their households, and their providers will inform the design of the program.

Serving more than 1.8 million students, the California (CA) community college (CC) system is a prime setting to deliver comprehensive tobacco screening, intervention and treatment to young adults, and especially to groups experiencing tobacco-related health disparities such as racial and ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities, those from lower socioeconomic status, and rural areas. A better understanding of tobacco use and co-use with alcohol and cannabis among CC students and how to implement interventions to meet their needs are warranted. 

Inequities in tobacco control from policy, screening, and cessation are evident with CA CCs. As of June 2022, only 62% of CA CCs have 100% tobacco-free policies, while all four-year public universities have been 100% tobacco-free since 2017. Also, the extent of tobacco treatment interventions vary given that only 92 of the 115 CCs have a student health center. A 2021 survey of 30 CA CC student health centers showed that while 93% screened for tobacco use, only 43% provided any interventions.  Currently there are no standard practices across CA CCs to deliver tobacco screening and intervention within student health or mental health visits.

Building off the work of CYAN’s College Program (community Co-PI) and a TRDRP New Investigator Award on CC’s tobacco-free policy adoption (academic Co-PI ), this pilot CPPRA study will (1) Investigate the extent of student screening and intervention services for tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use among CA CCs with student health centers; and (2) pilot an intervention to increase student engagement and to build CC’s capacity to effectively implement tobacco screening and intervention. In collaboration with CC stakeholders, this study will utilize existing and new quantitative (i.e., student/staff surveys), qualitative (i.e., interviews, listening sessions), and service data from a sample of CCs. This pilot study has potential for significant impact by identifying tobacco use and co-use patterns among CA CC students, and developing a student-centered process to screen and intervene across these substances.","This pilot CPPRA study seeks to  (Aim #1) Examine community college (CC) students’ tobacco use and co-use with alcohol and cannabis, and identify factors for students to reduce or quit tobacco use and co-use; (Aim #2) Investigate the extent of student screening and intervention services for tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use in a sample of 8-10 CA CCs; and (Aim #3) Integrating Aims 1 and 2, identify student-centered strategies that are feasible, acceptable, and appropriate for screening and intervention at CCs.  This study is co-led by the California Youth Advocacy Network and Public Health Institute, in collaboration with Ohlone College, California State University-Fullerton, University of California-Davis.

As a major Year 1 accomplishment, we have recruited and partnered with 10 California CCs: 5 in Northern, 2 in Central Coast, and 3 in Southern California. These CCs serve as sites for all study aims. In Aim 1, we are working on data management and creating matching survey weights for each college’s Healthy Minds Survey data, and recruiting and conducting student focus groups at each study site. With Aim 2, we are analyzing data from the Health Services Association California CC (HSACCC)’s annual survey of college student health and mental health services, and are conducting two key informant interviews at each CC. 

Key barriers include delayed start as the official agreement came in April 2024, and that we started in the middle of the academic year. Through leadership from Ohlone College and HSACCC, and co-PIs’ prior relationships, we overcame these barriers and used the summer to prepare and schedule Aims 1-2 data collection for Fall 2024. By end of Year 1, we have completed 6 student focus groups with 2 additional groups scheduled for November 2024, and 17 key informant interviews. For Year 2, we will complete the remaining qualitative data collection in the first quarter. We will then move to analyze the qualitative data, and integrate with quantitative data to identify key areas for improving tobacco screening and student-centered services."

My research focuses on understanding how tiny particles in the air, specifically those found in smoke, can affect the heart. These particles are known as PM2.5, which refers to fine particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. PM2.5 is commonly found in tobacco smoke, vehicle exhaust, and wildfire smoke, and it poses significant health risks, particularly to the heart and lungs.

Progress Toward Research Aims:
During this reporting period, I created laboratory models of heart tissue using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). These hiPSCs are stem cells generated from adult cells and can be used to develop any cell type in the body. My models allowed me to observe the effects of PM2.5 exposure on heart tissue. I discovered that when these heart tissues come into contact with PM2.5, they experience stress and their functionality is impaired. Notably, the damage persists even after the PM2.5 particles are removed, indicating long-term harmful effects.

Overcoming Barriers:
One of the significant challenges I faced was accurately mimicking the real-life conditions of PM2.5 exposure in my lab setting. By utilizing advanced techniques and working closely with collaborators, I was able to overcome this hurdle and create realistic exposure scenarios. Moreover, I have adapted the use of patient plasma use in the my culture models that helps mimic the similar conditions that patient heart is exposed. 

Major Accomplishments:
Developed and validated hiPSC-derived heart tissue models for studying PM2.5-induced damage.
Demonstrated that PM2.5 exposure leads to stress and dysfunction in heart tissues, with lasting effects even after removal of the particles.
I have optimized the exposure dose and duration that will used for the testing of drugs to identify potential treatments that could protect heart tissues from PM2.5 damage.

Plans for Continuation:
Moving forward, I will continue to test various medications to find those that can effectively shield heart tissues from the detrimental effects of PM2.5. My goal is to identify drugs that can prevent or mitigate the damage caused by polluted air, particularly smoke from wildfires and tobacco. If successful, this research could lead to new treatments that protect heart health in populations exposed to high levels of air pollution."

All of metabolism depends on flow of electrons that is mediated by four key molecules termed nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) coenzymes. Nicotine is closely related to nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, which are incorporated into NAD co-enzymes. Though the psychoactivity of nicotine and the toxicity of tobacco and e-cigarette components are well known, the potential of nicotine and other inhaled compounds to directly interfere with NAD metabolism and consequent metabolic processes, such as DNA repair, has not been investigated. Using precise methods to measure NAD metabolism, we will determine whether nicotine and e-cigarette toxicity is mediated, in part, by disturbances of the NAD system. This research has a profound potential to explain hazardous effects of tobacco and e-cigarette components and to help communicate dangers to young people.","Nicotine and nicotinic acid not only sound similar but they are chemically similar compounds. Nicotine is the psychoactive and addictive ingredient in cigarettes while nicotinic acid is a vitamin that our cells use to make NAD, the central catalyst of metabolism. Remarkably, no one had tested whether nicotine interferes with the NAD system. In this project, we have identified what appear to be three novel properties of nicotine. First, we found that exposure of cells to nicotine can cause them to convert NAD to ADPribose modifications of protein. Second, we have obtained preliminary evidence that nicotine can be incorporated into a nucleotide by NAMPT, a key NAD biosynthetic enzyme. Third, we have observed an apparent vesiculation effect of treating cells with nicotine. In the second year of this project, we will advance these results into manuscripts for peer review, develop a plan for follow-up work, and communicate our novel results to the community."

Our genes contain instructions (codes) for making proteins that do much of the work in our bodies, including transmitting signals to and from the brain. Only a small portion of genes actually code for proteins while the remaining “non-coding” region of genes is less well understood.  Instead of focusing on the parts of our genes that provide instructions for making proteins, we are looking at non-coding regions that were previously overlooked. Using advanced tools, we identified a specific change in the genetic code related to nicotine addiction in youth, amplifying the desire for nicotine in both adolescent rodents and humans. This is particularly crucial as adolescence represents a critical period when the brain is uniquely vulnerable to the allure of addictive substances like nicotine.
 
Unlike previous studies that concentrated on specific protein-coding areas of genes, we honed in on a specific genetic variation in a non-coding region. To better understand this, we created a special group of rats with a genetic change similar to what we observed in adolescent humans. This helps us bridge the gap between our animal models and human adolescents.
 
Our main goal is to figure out how this genetic change influences behaviors related to adolescent nicotine use. We believe it might affect the signaling or other biological features of key areas of the adolescent brain associated with reward. By unraveling these connections, we hope to identify new proteins that play a role in adolescent addiction.
 
Understanding how these genetic variations impact addiction, especially considering the rise in nicotine use among California youth, is crucial. Our research could potentially lead to the development of new treatments to help adolescents quit nicotine use. In summary, our work not only contributes to the field of adolescent addiction science but also holds promise for future drug development discoveries, offering hope for a healthier future for the youth of California.","1. Brief Overview of the project:
The goal of the current research project aims to evaluate the genetic mechanisms of nicotine addiction. Using a humanized rat line that carries a genetic modification (CHRNA6 3'UTR SNP) found in humans, our studies illustrate that a distinct nicotinic receptor found in brain reward neurons regulates nicotine seeking behavior. The current studies aim to investigate the mechanisms mediating our behavioral findings.
2. Progress toward the completion of the stated research aims: 
We have made significant progress toward completion of our aims.  In a prior paper (Carreño et al., 2024A, we illustrate that the CHRNA6 3'UTR SNP impacts tissue level neurotransmitter levels in brain reward regions which correlate with nicotine seeking behavior. In our most recent publication (Carreño et al., 2024B), we illustrate functional impacts of the alpha6 nAChRs due to the CHRNA6 3'UTR SNP in mediating nicotine and stimulate induced dopamine release in brain reward regions. This relates to specific aim 2 of our grant.  We have also now pushed forward with assessing RNA expression levels in brain reward regions in our  CHRNA6 3'UTR SNP rat lines, providing preliminary studies illustrating mechanisms mediating the behavioral effects observed in our rat lines. This relates to specific aim 1 of our research grant. In parallel, we have pushed forward with illustrating in vitro expression of 1 of 4 small open reading frame microproteins, providing support for translation of unique proteins from the human 3'UTR. Followup studies are assessing whether ribosomal sequencing can predict protein translation in our humanized rat lines in order to push forward with assessing Mass Spec analysis our the microproteins. 
3. Barriers that were overcome or not overcome. 
We have illustrated gene expression changes in brain reward regions of our humanized rat lines, functional nicotine & stimulant-induced neurotransmitter release in brain reward regions in the CHRNA6 3'UTR SNP rats, and provide the first evidence for microprotein translation in vitro of a microprotein in the human 3'UTR. 
4. Summary or list of the major accomplishments of the research.

5. Plans for the continuation of the research or project. 
We plan to further explore the in vivo translation of microproteins in the CHRNA6 3'UTR SNP rats and increase the 'n' of our gene expression studies in brain reward regions, providing support for all three specific aims of our grant."

Prior research has shown screening to be a promising tool for reducing deaths from this deadly disease. Despite being recommended for nearly a decade, lung cancer screening remains uncommon among prior and current tobacco users. Across the U.S., only 6% of those who are eligible for lung cancer screening have received this potentially lifesaving test. The situation in California is even worse; only 1% of eligible California residents have received lung cancer screening, placing California in a tie with Wyoming for last place in the nation with regard to lung cancer screening. This important screening test is mostly accessible through academic medical centers, contributing to even lower uptake among racial/ethnic minority, low income, and immigrant residents who may not receive care in these settings. Few prior studies have focused specifically on population subgroups who may be at higher risk for lung cancer due to smoking history, or have historically worse lung cancer outcomes, but are less likely to be offered lung cancer screening. Therefore, we propose an academic-community partnered pilot study to gather data in diverse communities at elevated risk for poor lung cancer outcomes (Black, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Latinx, low-income white) in the preferred language of the participant. In each group, we will conduct a series of interviews with community members who are eligible for screening as well as with representatives of community organizations and clinics that serve these respective communities. We will seek to understand barriers and facilitators to lung cancer screening so that we may develop appropriate interventions to increase screening, which we will develop, deliver and test in the next phases of our research. As such, this pilot study represents an important first step toward reducing the impact of lung cancer in California and beyond.","1)	A brief overview of the project
We will assess various perspectives on lung cancer and screening through interviews with community members who have smoked or still smoke, family members, healthcare providers, as well as representatives of community organizations that serve our communities of focus. We plan to focus on lower income and racial/ethnic minority communities who are at elevated risk for poor lung cancer outcomes (i.e. Black, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Latinx, low-income Whites). We will use these interviews to inform best strategies for identifying and reaching individuals eligible for lung cancer screening, particularly in settings where greater barriers to accessing healthcare exist. 

2)	Progress toward the completion of the state research alma.
We have finalized the recruitment plan and instruments that will be used for the pilot study. This includes the development of interview guides that will be used to assess perspectives about lung cancer screening during semi-structured interviews with community members, healthcare providers, and community organization representatives. These interview guides are foundational in understanding the full scope of our research questions and will help to inform the next phase of the study. We will initiate participant recruitment shortly. 

3)	Barriers that were overcome or not overcome.
The project was initially delayed due to administrative hurdles and recruitment and hiring of project staff. These barriers have been overcome and we expect progress to accelerate this year.

4)	A summary or list of the major accomplishments of the research.
Study instruments have been finalized and reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). All necessary project staff have been hired and onboarded, and recruitment of study participants will begin shortly upon contact with identified Los Angeles community organizations. We have initiated contact with community advisors such as the University of California Lung Cancer Consortium (UCLCC), to garner suggestions for making contact with community members for recruitment, as well as connect with other lung cancer researchers and experts. 

5)	Plans for continuation of the research or project. 
We will work to increase lung cancer screening in Los Angeles County by evaluating a community-partnered intervention based on evidence from the pilot study interview perspectives. We will conduct follow-up interviews with recruited participants to solicit feedback on this intervention. A future larger scale study will work to develop and test this intervention program, further leveraging the network of community organizations and members built during the pilot phase of the project."

As new products and forms of administration for nicotine and cannabis have emerged, increasing co-use of multiple types tobacco use and of tobacco and cannabis among young adults has also been observed and is particularly concerning for the associated physical and mental health consequences. Yet, the factors leading to transition from electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) to other tobacco and co-use of two or more tobacco products, and ENDS and cannabis co-use remain poorly understood. Currently, there are no systems for monitoring the market introduction of emerging ENDS and cannabis vapes to assess their impact on use patterns. This study will adapt existing approaches in data science, quantitative, and qualitative research to develop a surveillance system of emerging ENDS and cannabis vapes to elucidate their impact on ENDS, tobacco, and cannabis use patterns. The objective of this proposal is to determine the effect of exposure to and engagement with ENDS and cannabis vapes on transitions from mono-ENDS use to other tobacco product and cannabis use. Surveillance of digital assets will be conducted to monitor the introduction of popular and emerging ENDS and cannabis vapes as they are digitally marketed during the study period (Specific Aim 1). Highly marketed products will form the basis of a longitudinal survey on engagement with new products and its relationship with transitions in tobacco and cannabis use patterns (Specific Aim 2).

To achieve this goal, we will establish a tobacco and cannabis product surveillance system to detect new and emerging products and survey young adult e-cigarette users over six months to identify how exposure to new and emerging tobacco and cannabis products affects tobacco and cannabis use patterns. During the reporting period, we have made progress toward the first study specific aim by setting up the tobacco and cannabis product surveillance system to identify new and emerging tobacco and cannabis products and have begun data collection on various digital platforms. We have made progress toward the second study specific aim by developing recruitment materials and survey instrument and obtaining human subjects institutional review board approval to conduct cognitive interviews for further refinement of the survey instrument. Progress toward the third study specific aim will not commence until the second study specific aim is completed. Challenges have included a lengthy competitive vendor selection process per institutional requirements and delays setting up the subaward with UCSD and subsequent onboarding of project staff. Both challenges have been resolved. Major accomplishments of the study include: operationalizing the concepts of “new” and “emerging” tobacco and cannabis products in measurable ways with available resources; starting market surveillance data collection to identify new and emerging tobacco and cannabis products; establishing the contractual relationship with the survey vendor; and developing a survey instrument for testing in cognitive interviews.

This complex disease is caused by the dysfunction or loss of pancreatic islet insulin-producing β cells. Cigarette smoking is a well-recognized risk factor for both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as it was associated with islet β cell damage and impaired insulin secretion. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smokers represent 20.8% of the US adult population and present a 30% to 40% higher risk to develop diabetes compared with non-smokers.  In addition, children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy were up to four times more likely to develop diabetes later in life compared with children who were never exposed to nicotine during their embryonic development, suggesting that cigarette smoking may have an intergenerational impact on diabetes development. Yet, the effect of perinatal exposure on the development of the pancreas and its consequences on hyperglycemia are poorly understood. Our in vivo preliminary data shows rats exposed to nicotine during their embryonic development are born with impaired pancreas vasculature. These findings are associated with a decreased number of β cells, suggesting impaired angiogenesis and pancreas development processes in nicotine-exposed offspring. Understanding how perinatal nicotine exposure enhances the pancreas’s vulnerability to diabetes and hinders its ability to regenerate after β cell loss is critical to develop therapeutic solutions that present the potential to correct the vascular dysfunction and reverse the pancreatic islet’s deficient regenerative capacity in offspring.","E-cigarettes, also known as vapes, have emerged as an alternative to conventional smoking, perceived by some as a healthier choice. Nicotine from these sources can disrupt metabolic processes in developing fetal organs, potentially leading to metabolic diseases in offspring later in life. However, the maternal inheritance of nicotine effects and their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In Year 1 (July 2023-June 2024), we aimed to characterize the severity of pancreatic development and vasculature impairment in young and adult offspring. To investigate the effects of perinatal e-cigarette exposure on fetal pancreatic development and its association with adult-onset diabetes, we exposed C57/BL6 female mice to nicotine aerosols using an e-cigarette exposure chamber for approximately 48 days. The mice were exposed one week before mating, continuing through pregnancy and lactation until the weaning of the offspring (21 days after birth). Body weight and blood glucose levels were routinely monitored for both dams and offspring. We found that offspring from nicotine-exposed dams exhibited lower body weight. Furthermore, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (i.p.GTT) showed significant dysregulation of glucose tolerance in offspring from nicotine-exposed dams at 8 weeks of age. Intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests (i.p.ITT) indicated a normal insulin response in these offspring. We identified a set of genes that were differentially expressed in the hypothalamus, pancreatic islets, and white adipose tissue (WAT) of offspring from nicotine-exposed dams. A wide variety of gene dysregulations were observed in the offspring, with a common downregulation of PPARγ signaling in islets and WAT. Our ongoing research aims to elucidate the transgenerational effects of nicotine exposure on metabolic dysfunction in offspring, including the potential dysregulatory mechanisms of nicotine exposure in inter-organ communication. Notably, we identified cotinine as a major nicotine metabolite transmitted to offspring. We will further dissect cell-type-specific influences of nicotine and it’s metabolite cortinine exposure in offspring. In addition, we will investigate whether the restoration of PPARγ signaling improves glucose intolerance and diabetic incidence in offspring, exploring potential therapies for smoking/e-cigarette-induced diabetes."

In contrast, with recreational legalization, cannabis availability and use have increased and the prevalence of cannabis use in California is higher than the national average. Studies have raised concerns that co-use of cannabis can make it more difficult to quit tobacco. Unfortunately, few studies have focused specifically on co-use and little is known about how cannabis has impacted tobacco use behavior and the specific barriers that co-use creates for quitting. 

We used a national cohort of US adults to compare changes in tobacco and cannabis use from 2017 to 2021. We found that though overall tobacco use declined, co-use with cannabis showed small increases. As our study aimed to represent the general population, only a minority of the cohort used tobacco alone or with cannabis. Therefore, the sample was too small to determine how co-use impacted tobacco cessation. Similarly, though other longitudinal surveys capture data on cannabis and tobacco, none are specifically focused on co-use. They do not measure factors that will be critical to designing interventions, including specific aspects of motivation, what patients perceive as barriers to cessation, and among those who attempt to quit, reasons why they fail or relapse. In addition, cannabis use is diverse, and it is not clear whether any co-use interferes with cessation or whether there are specific patients at highest risk. Frequency of cannabis use, presence of cannabis use disorder, potency of cannabis used and reasons for cannabis use may all be risk factors for decreased and/or unsuccessful quit attempts 

We propose to recruit a diverse cohort of 2,800 US adults who currently use tobacco (cigarettes or vaping) and survey them in 2023, 2024, and 2025. We will collect detailed information on tobacco/cannabis use patterns. Recruiting only those who are already using tobacco will yield a much larger sample with the ability to study the impact of cannabis on motivation to quit tobacco, explore barriers to quitting tobacco, and examine reasons for relapse in detail. This work will inform policy and programs focused on tobacco cessation, reduce exposure to tobacco and improve the health of Californians.","Our project will use a national, longitudinal survey to examine how co-use of cannabis impacts the ability of people to quit tobacco, including how it effects their motivation to quit, barriers, and success with quitting. Our goal for the first year of the grant was to recruit a diverse survey cohort of approximately 2,800 US adults who currently used tobacco (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or other nicotine vaping products) and complete a baseline survey. During Year 1, we submitted our survey protocol to the UCSF Institutional Review Board, which certified it as Exempt. We also worked with our study team, community partner, and survey company to pilot test and finalize the survey. With feedback from internal piloting and our study team, we made minor changes, such as expanding our description of e-cigarettes and nicotine vaping products and adding pictures to help participants understand the wide range of products included. We also revised our measure of cannabis use disorder from the proposed Cannabis Use Disorder Identification Test-Revised to the DSM-5 Checklist, which assessed cannabis use according to DSM criteria and will provide more accurate diagnostic information. Following internal pilot testing, we formally pilot tested the survey with Ipsos KnowledgePanel and approved a final English and Spanish version. 

We launched the survey in November 2023 to 5,034 KnowledgePanel members who had reported a history of tobacco use. Of these, 3,167 completed survey screening (63% response rate) and 2,804 qualified for our full survey given current use of tobacco, meeting our recruitment goal. We have run quality checks on the data and conducted analyses for several of the aims. We are also sharing our findings with our community partner, Breathe California, to incorporate in their ongoing education and advocacy efforts. Our plans for the coming year are to complete the baseline analyses and begin pilot testing our Year 2 survey with anticipated launch in November 2024."

Ninety percent of those who smoke tobacco initiate smoking before the age of 18, when the developing brain is most vulnerable. Forty to seventy percent of the tobacco use risk factors are heritable, but genetic studies of have been underpowered, limiting our ability to improve our biological understanding of tobacco use disorders (TUDs) and the identification of novel therapeutics and preventive mechanisms. Tobacco use is correlated with externalizing (EXT) behaviors (e.g., impulsivity, aggression), which have adverse impacts throughout the lifespan. The Externalizing Consortium has conducted the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) of EXT (N=1.5M), which identified >500 genetic risk loci. This study uncovered substantial genetic associations between EXT and tobacco use behaviors. However, the pathways whereby EXT affect tobacco use behaviors is largely unknown – including potential sex-specific effects and changes over time. This proposal will leverage genetic signal for EXT to assess their effects on tobacco use by sex and across the lifespan. Aim 1 will expand the original EXT GWAS, and curate phenotypic tobacco use and EXT traits in several cohorts which span across sex and multiple ages (e.g., Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD; ages 9-14+], Add Health [ages 12+], All of Us [ages 18+], UK Biobank [ages 40-69+], Psychiatric Genomics Consortium [ages 18+]). Phenotypic relationships amongst tobacco and EXT traits by sex will be inspected and sex-specific GWAS analyses of tobacco and EXT phenotypes will be performed. Aim 2 will assess the role of tobacco use and EXT polygenic scores across tobacco use and EXT behaviors by sex and over time in cohorts of different ancestries (e.g., European, African). Genetic liability for EXT may explain greater variance of tobacco use in adolescence, whereas specific genetic liability for tobacco dependence may become more important as individuals age. Aim 3 will assess the interplay between tobacco use and EXT polygenic scores and other comorbid outcomes, including psychopathology and social determinants of health. This work will provide support for future prevention and cessation treatments to be tailored to individual genetic differences by sex and throughout the lifespan.","Overview: This project explores genetic factors that may contribute to tobacco use behaviors in males and females across the lifespan. We aim to understand how certain genetic variations relate to behaviors associated with substance use and risk-taking. Using a large dataset from 3.8 million individuals with European-like ancestry and 253,000 with African-like ancestry, the Externalizing Consortium, of which I am a collaborator and core analyst, developed an advanced model called EXT 2.0. This model examines how genetics can influence behaviors like smoking, cannabis use, and general risk tolerance. Through our analyses, we are beginning to see differences in how these genetic factors might work in males versus females.

Progress and Major Findings: We made significant progress in developing a model that links genetic variations with externalizing behaviors, including tobacco use disorder and antisocial behaviors. In individuals with European-like ancestry, our model found strong connections between genetic risk factors for various substance use behaviors, while similar patterns emerged in African-like individuals, with some variation. Our analysis identified over 1,400 unique genetic markers associated with these behaviors, suggesting shared genetic pathways for externalizing behaviors. I led further analysis in a diverse electronic health record cohort and found links between genetic risk scores and smoking-related behaviors and sex-specific morbidity outcomes. Additionally, I tested these scores in adolescents and found that higher genetic risk scores correlated with increased likelihood of smoking behaviors in youth, with females showing particularly high scores. This underscores the potential of genetic markers to help predict early risk behaviors.
Challenges and Overcoming Barriers: One major challenge was balancing genetic diversity across ancestry groups. Since most available data are from individuals of European ancestry, we used advanced methods to ensure meaningful results across different ancestry backgrounds. We also carefully standardized data across studies to maintain consistent analysis.
Future Plans: We will soon finish analyzing sex-specific genetic differences in tobacco use across ancestry groups. We are preparing manuscripts to share these findings, with publication planned by year’s end. This research emphasizes the value of sex- and ancestry-specific analyses in developing targeted interventions for substance use behaviors."

Additionally, the Center established the Community Partner Workgroup, which actively participated in two quarterly workshops designed to prepare them for upcoming community-based participatory research (CBPR). The RRP Core began implementing RRPs for three policy initiatives: 1) Smokefree Outdoor Dining in the City of San Diego, 2) Eliminate Tobacco Product Waste (TPW) in Tribal Outdoor Recreational Areas, and 3) Disclosure of Thirdhand Smoke Pollution in Real Estate Transactions. The Center’s Training and Capacity-Building Core has offered ongoing educational training opportunities such as journal clubs, policy roundtables, and webinars for students and emerging researchers. Moreover, the Center has successfully hosted the first annual Symposium for Tobacco and the Environment, with over 90 attendees from the community, researchers, and tobacco policy advocates. Lastly, a pilot project was selected and funded. Research and activities planned for next year include completing RRP implementation for all six policy initiatives, using CBPR strategies to plan new initiatives for Years 3 and 4, and engaging with legislators and decision-makers to support policy changes."

A 2021 tobacco cessation summit identified key areas to advance tobacco cessation in California.  To support California’s aspirations towards a tobacco “Endgame” that maintains low levels of tobacco use, tobacco cessation is a key part of the plan.

The Tobacco Cessation Policy Research Center (TCPRC) is a multidisciplinary collaborative effort bringing together academic researchers, community and advocacy organizations, and policy stakeholders. The TCPRC organizing themes are on the TRDRP priority topics of “policies strengthening the availability of community-level cessation resources”, “menthol and flavored tobacco regulation and implementation”, and “activities directly relating to the California Endgame Initiative.” The TCPRC’s mission is to build capacity for health care access, promote excellence in health care delivery, facilitate health care and community engagement, and achieve equity in health plan coverage. The TCPRC’s goals are 1) to generate evidence that can support tobacco cessation policy adoption and implementation, 2) to collaborate with community and policy stakeholders for optimizing policy impacts, and 3) to develop the pipeline of researchers for sustaining the TCPRC mission. Based in Sacramento at UC Davis, the TCPRC serves, but is not limited to, Northern California and beyond.

TCPRC organizational partners include American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network as the lead advocacy organization with a political strategist, UCLA for health economic and tobacco policy expertise, and UC Center Sacramento to facilitate policy stakeholder engagement.  The TCPRC includes four Cores (Administration, Evaluation, Community, and Training) and Scientific and Community Advisory Boards. For the first two years, Rapid Response policy projects address key areas for existing and potential legislative policies for tobacco cessation. The four studies address health care access with community pharmacies, health care delivery with substance use disorder facilities, health care engagement on flavored tobacco product cessation, and health plan reform for coverage.","The Tobacco Cessation Policy Research Center (TCPRC) is a multidisciplinary collaborative whose goals are to generate evidence on policy, to collaborate with community and policy stakeholders, and to develop the pipeline of researchers. In its first year, TCPRC has established and convened its 4 Cores (Administrative, Community, Evaluation, Training), a Community and Scientific Advisory Boards, and Policy Project Teams. The Community Core launched a quarterly stakeholder meeting for policy project feedback and a Summit is planned for fall 2024. The Training Core conducted a spring seminar on tobacco cessation policy, and an Early Stage Investigator Pilot application is under revision. Policy Project Progress: For Project 1 (Access with pharmacies), we recruited 18 pharmacies from the Community Pharmacy Enhanced Services Network to address reimbursement barriers with AB 1114. The pharmacies meet weekly about workflows, billing claims, and sustainable payment models. For Project 2 (Delivery with substance use disorder (SUD) facilities), we partnered with Sacramento County’s tobacco and SUD programs to administer a brief survey among SUD facility Executive Directors about AB 541 implementation. Among 33% of organizations responding, the majority reported screening and offering treatment, and requested client materials and provider training. For Project 3 (Engagement on flavored tobacco), we began drafting a local Tobacco Cessation Policy Fact Sheet and our lead community partner identified a need for enforcement data. We requested data from the Department of Justice but identified data quality issues; we obtained Sacramento County’s data from the California Tobacco Prevention Program’s Ending Commercial Tobacco Campaign survey. For Project 4 (Equity with health plans), the team conducted a review of California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) data and identified that 25 of 31 had evidence of coverage language for behavioral counseling and most have one medication coverage; we will continue to clarify. Other accomplishments: Two manuscripts were published, UCD piloted and advises on the National Committee for Quality Assurance quality metrics for tobacco and lung cancer screening, ACR 196 for “lung cancer awareness month” was drafted with ACS CAN, and TCPRC provided input to national requests about over-the-counter preventive services and tobacco cessation in children."

With our proposed university partner at Stanford University and research Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Bonnie Halper-Felsher, tobacco control equity scholars will engage in research to examine smoking, vaping and other tobacco use influences, prevention and treatment from a diverse and equity lens, and how tobacco use impacts their lives and their communities.  We will recruit and train up to 15 community college students to participate in the SVFSI scholars initiative.  The tobacco priority populations targeted for student recruitment will include: [1] Individuals with mental illness; [2] People of low socioeconomic status; [3] People with disabilities, specifically students who are deaf/hard of hearing; and [4] Racial/ethnic minorities.  The range of tobacco-related research opportunities and activities available to scholars will include training sessions and a summer tobacco control academy, policy and advocacy projects designed to create change at the local level, the use of photovoice as a research methodology, and various research projects designed to build basic research skills set.  Topics may include social determinants of health and its impact on tobacco use; the role of social media on vaping; the impact of adolescent brain development and its susceptibility to tobacco-related advertisement; the evolving electronic cigarette market and its influence on young adults and minority populations.  The team’s experience with fostering the careers of students is diverse and comprises individuals from both academic and student services, all of whom have had a long presence at Ohlone College and are heavily involved in multiple initiatives and shared governance.  The program’s potential impact will help train the next generation of researchers to reduce smoking and vaping behaviors in the communities they represent, and create a pathway for scholars to engage in tobacco policy and advocacy.","Our project is designed to allow students at Ohlone College the chance to train with Stanford research mentors and conduct original research in tobacco use and control. The scholars build their knowledge base and critical skill sets in research, writing, and community engagement in ways that allow them thought leaders in tobacco control, culminating in advocacy work in Alameda County. 

This year we began with a cohort of four scholars selected from a competitive candidate pool of nearly forty applicants in Fall 2023. Due to the nature of the grant’s arrival time, we started with our cohort much later than planned, necessitating the extension of the work through the summer of 2024 with cohort one. These scholars represented several of the different target groups in our proposal and demonstrated excellence in academic work as well as other areas including research, civic engagement, and co-curricular activities. The scholars were paired with research mentors in January 2024 and began the onboarding process. 
Quickly we discovered a few challenges, most notably the issue of paying the scholars as employees which was much more complicated due to financial aid restrictions and transportation, which was much more expensive (and complicated) than we anticipated. One way that we responded to some of the smaller challenges around the expectations scholars had around the program was to develop a program syllabus which we will revise and continue to each in each annual cycle. As a result of interventions like this, we saw early on some great work from the scholars as the projects took shape. The most significant issue was the need to dismiss one of the scholars due to attendance issues at both the lab meetings and at Ohlone, along with accuracy problems with the scholar’s time and effort logs. The scholar was put on a performance improvement plan, but was unsuccessful in making significant changes, so the scholar was separated from the program in May 2024. 

Scholars will continue their work this summer and attend the Annual We hope to report on the findings of this first group of scholars in our next report as they have not completed their research or their advocacy projects at the time of the writing of this report."

This question has not yet been answered.  The PIs will work in conjunction with the Latino Coordinating Center (LCC) and the California Health Collaborative (located in Fresno City) to create a multi-component Smoke and Vape Free Scholars Initiative (SVFSI) program focused on that question at CSU Fresno. Together with the LCC, the PIs will recruit 3 cohorts of 5 first generation Latinx (FGL) students at CSU Fresno who will consider this question in a culturally and methodologically relevant manner. The program will integrate research, advocacy projects, participant development, and comprehensive mentorship by engaging in tobacco control advocacy and research  projects that have been identified as high-priority by the LCC and focuses on the Latinx community in Fresno. Currently, the LCC has identified several research projects that progress into advocacy projects. This cohort of students will work with researchers at CSU Fresno, UC Merced, and the LCC to (1) turn information collected during advocacy activities into published reports available to community stakeholders,  and (2) to work with the PIs to design and implement a advocacy/research project identified by the LCC, which will result in manuscripts, and as well as presentations to professional conferences.  Subsequently, these research efforts will direct and shape targeted advocacy projects identified by LCC. The integration of research and advocacy will begin to build a tobacco control research hub linking the 3 institutions and help the trainees learn to identify and design advocacy and research projects that meet community needs.  Furthermore, given the uniqueness of the target student population, participant development activities that are tailored to the Latinx FGL college-going excperience and intentional mentorship will play an integral role in the proposed program. Finally, through this program’s focus, we hope to generate new perspectives on the question of what the tobacco control endgame means for the Latinx residents in agricultural areas of California, while developing capacity among emerging Latinx adults.","This proposal aims to create a partnership among CSU Fresno (CSUF), the Latino Coordinating Center (LCC, which is a California Tobacco Control Program statewide coordinating center for the Latino population in California), and UC Merced’s Nicotine and Cannabis Policy Center (NCPC) that focuses on understanding how to convey the importance of the tobacco endgame to residents of Fresno County region and developing a local pipeline of advocacy and research focused on the specific area. By creating a cohort of young adult tobacco control advocates who can understand the lived experiences of this area and are themselves, members of the target community, the proposed program will help to create the infrastructure needed to reach the endgame. 
During the first year of the grant, significant progress was made on finalizing the three studies that will be part of the research projects that these scholars will be engaged in. Furthermore, we initiated a vibrant recruitment effort the resulted in the inaugural cohort to begin during the 2024 -2025 academic year. Currently, the team has worked on the design and implementation of research projects. It is anticipated that during the first year of implementation, there will be clearer direction with respect to dissemination efforts, conference presentations and prospective publications.
For the most part, there were administrative barriers that were presented. Specifically, in reference to ensuring that the stipends that would be provided to our scholars were not negatively impacted their financial aid was a hurdle that took quite some time to reconcile with the university. However, through our continuous efforts we were able to come to an agreement and identify a strategy that was beneficial to the students and did not have a negative impact on them.
With respect to accomplishments, the team has worked hard to successfully craft the research studies and development activities that will be the focus of efforts for the BITER scholars. There are plans for modifications as we review results of the assessments, we plan to have participants complete. These modifications will solely be focused on program strengthening and improvement, if needed."

Youth who use e-cigarettes on school campus are oftentimes treated punitively via detention, suspension, or expulsion. Punitive measures do not address root causes of why the student is using and do not motivate the student to quit. Suspensions are higher among youth of color, negatively impacting educational outcomes and graduation rates. Educating students and providing them with resources to quit is more effective at reducing and stopping adolescent e-cigarette use. Alternative-to-suspension (ATS) programs offer a solution to schools and students who are found using e-cigarettes on campus; however, there are few ATS programs available to schools, and fewer evaluated. Using community-based participatory research (CBPR), we developed Healthy Futures: Alterative-to-Suspension Program within our widely used Tobacco Prevention Toolkit. Healthy Futures uses principles of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy, incorporates a restorative practice and trauma-informed lens, and touches on all the salient issues involved in students’ use of tobacco, including sessions on the brain and addiction, health effects, cost, and wellness. The Stanford REACH Lab and California School-Based Health Alliance (CSHA) will partner to evaluate Healthy Futures using a school-based randomized waitlist-controlled trial in 20 high schools in California (10 Healthy Futures treatment schools and 10 control schools). Our project aims are to assess changes in the perspectives of school administrators, educators, counselors, and health staff around the feasibility, acceptability, and usefulness of implementing Healthy Futures as an appropriate and effective response to tobacco use on campus; assess high school students’ acceptability and perceptions of Healthy Futures; and estimate the extent to which Healthy Futures changes high school students’ knowledge of, attitudes towards, intentions to use, and actual use of e-cigarettes. As a result of evaluating and further disseminating Healthy Futures, we aim to significantly increase adolescents’ knowledge of and decrease positive attitudes, intentions to use, and actual use of tobacco including e-cigarettes. We also expect to reduce rates of suspension and improve schools’ acceptability of Healthy Futures.",

Since 2012, over 1200 daily smokers and their family members have participated in the program.  The program has shown high participation rates, with over 90% of participants completing the program including follow-up check-ins. It effectively engages smokers who are not ready to quit smoking (26% to 55% had no intention to quit smoking within six months in various studies). Additionally, the program has shown evidence in helping people stop smoking.  At 3, 6, and 12 months check-ins, 22% to 35% of participants were able to stop for at least 7 days. We have recently developed and tested a thirdhand smoke education and cleaning program for former Chinese smokers and their families. Participants reported high satisfaction, strong confidence in staying smoke-free and consistent enforcement of household smoking ban. Many also became “ambassadors” for promoting smoke-free environments in their social circles. Our proposed study will expand the Health Family Project's “Quit Smoking For a Healthy Family” (QS) curriculum by integrating it with the thirdhand smoke education and cleaning program, creating a new “Smokefree Family Living” (SFL) intervention for Chinese American families as our initial focus. We will examine if SFL is more effective that the original QS curriculum in motivating smokers to quit smoking, achieving long-term smoking abstinence, and reducing secondhand and thirdhand smoke exposure. This will be tested by comparing 2 groups of a total of 320 Chinese smoker-family pairs in California. The proposed study will be one of the first family-based lay health worker outreach programs targeting the full spectrum of smoking cessation and relapse prevention, and the elimination of secondhand and thirdhand smoke exposure.",

In general, this research finds higher levels of tobacco product use among LGBT+ youth compared to their heterosexual, cisgender peers. However, our TRDRP high-impact pilot award (2018 – 2021) demonstrated important subgroup differences in tobacco use among LGBT+ youth, with transgender and gender non-binary (TGNB) emerging adults (18 – 29 years old) experiencing the highest rates of tobacco product use compared to their cisgender peers. TGNB youth are socially located at the intersection of multiple vulnerabilities that contribute to higher rates of tobacco product use, including discrimination, harassment, unemployment, and housing instability. To our knowledge, there are no culturally tailored interventions focused on tobacco cessation for TGNB emerging adults. This TRDRP community-partnered participatory research proposal builds upon a long-standing community-academic partnership between the Los Angeles LGBT Center, a large community-based provider of health and social services to LGBT+ people, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Hub for Health Intervention, Policy and Practice (HHIPP). We propose a four-phase mixed-methods study to develop and test a tobacco cessation intervention for TGNB youth. In Phase 1, we will conduct assessments guided by the Intervention Mapping (IM) Framework, and the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) framework to identify key mechanisms, intervention objectives, and organizational infrastructure. In Phase 2, we will follow the IM framework to culturally tailor “Courage to Quit,” a tobacco cessation program that has been successfully utilized with LGBT+ communities. In Phase 3, we will pilot test this intervention with TGNB young adult (ages 18-29) cigarette smokers and tobacco vaping users (ages 18 – 29) to determine the efficacy of the intervention as measured using biochemically verified tobacco status at intervention completion and 6-month follow-up. In Phase 4, we will use both quantitative and qualitative intervention evaluation and implementation science measures to evaluate intervention effectiveness, as well as feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness for scalability in other LGBT-serving community-based organizations.",

Cigarette smoking (active) and being around someone else smoking (passive) are also preventable risk factors for GC. Smokers are more likely to develop GC from Hp infection than non-smokers and toxic components in cigarettes also make Hp-treatment less effective. Because the smoking rate among KAs is one of the highest in California, the harmful link between smoking and Hp is of particular concern for KAs. Furthermore, Hp testing and treatment has not been commonly used in the US, drawing attention from KA community. In this proposal, we aim to further expand our growing community-academia partnership and broaden research capacity to develop appropriate public health interventions. Our aims are: (1) To strengthen collaborative capacity between USC, Koreatown Senior Community Center (KSCC), and community advisory board (CAB) to co-design a mixed method study on smoking and GC among KA smokers to identify actionable intervention targets. We will expand our current USC-KSCC-CAB collaboration, host annual town hall meetings and organize a “Smoke-free for Healthy Stomach” coalition engaging additional stakeholders for tobacco use and gastric health. (2) To assess how common Hp infection is among 200 active and passive KA smokers using a rapid non-invasive test and to assess changes in intention for reducing exposure to tobacco upon Hp detection, (3) To identify potential intervention targets to sustainably reduce tobacco exposure and Hp infection among KA families. We will invite 30 KA adults with Hp infection and their family members and conduct focus groups to discuss ways how health messaging should be written and delivered to reduce tobacco exposure and improve gastric health. We will disseminate findings via community-led efforts, media outlets, and publications. Results from this pilot will inform developing a full CPPRA application that has a high potential in identifying and testing culturally-appropriate intervention strategies.",

For example, Black and Latiné youth tobacco product use increases the risk of addiction, reduced lung function, and early cardiovascular damage in the short term and contributes to tobacco-related health disparities (e.g., lung cancer) in the long term. It is therefore troubling that smoke shops—whose adverse public health effects remain poorly understood—are disproportionately located in Black and Latiné communities such as Westmont/West Athens, CA. Furthermore, smoke shops (1) are associated with increased rates of youth smoking initiation; (2) sell numerous e-cigarette products whose use is exploding among Black and Latiné youth; and (3) represent public nuisances that attract community crime and violence. However, no studies that we know of have examined the relationships between Black and Latiné youth tobacco product exposure and use within their everyday activity spaces (e.g., public parks, libraries, recreation centers), which our preliminary Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program-funded observational research suggests may be influenced by smoke shops in these communities.

Building on our team’s community-partnered research, our two-year pilot study proposal seeks to address this gap by examining the following research question: How do smoke shops located in close proximity to youth activity spaces influence Black and Latiné youth exposure to and use of tobacco products in Westmont/West Athens? Working with Advocates for Peace and Urban Unity (Co-PI and Executive Director Kevin Orange), we will leverage our team’s strong community-academic partnership to engage youth and key stakeholders (e.g., parents, community organizers) in our research. First, we will use our team’s innovative participatory mapping approach to identify and categorize the primary activity spaces where youth are exposed to and use tobacco products and their proximity to smoke shops. Next, we will use photovoice to explore youth lived experience of tobacco product exposure and use around youth activity spaces and smoke shops. Finally, we will use Participatory Geographic Information Systems to develop a tobacco product exposure and use risk index that informs geographically-targeted youth tobacco prevention outreach.",

While examinations of gender identity disparities in tobacco use have been well documented, less is known about how these disparities vary by race/ethnicity. Ample research has shown that SGM individuals smoke cigarettes due, at least in large part, to discrimination and other forms of minority stress. Research has also shown that racial/ethnic minorities such as African Americans, exhibit higher levels of stress (finances, relationship conflicts, and discrimination). However, little research exists on the intersection of sexual and gender minority and racial/ethnic identities and nicotine/tobacco use. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between stressors and tobacco use at the intersection of gender identity and race/ethnicity utilizing two population-based samples in California. 
Methods: Data will be obtained from Waves 3 and 4 of the ADVANCE study (n=~4,000), a longitudinal analysis of an ongoing study of behavioral health among Southern California high school students. Utilizing data from the ADVANCE study will allow us to examine the impact of discrimination stress on tobacco use among adolescents and young adults in Southern California. We will also use data from the Smoking Cessation in Sexual Minority Couples (SYNC) study (n=212), an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study to examine the impact of socioeconomic stress on tobacco use among sexual minority adults in California. Both studies will examine the role of race/ethnicity as a moderator of the relationship between self-reported stressors and tobacco use.
Significance: Understanding the relationship between multiple identities, stressors, and tobacco use can better inform public health professionals, policymakers, and educators to help create culturally tailored interventions and campaigns to disseminate accurate information in ways that are equitable and equally understandable to different minority groups to reduce SGM tobacco disparities.",

Head and neck cancers (HNC), the majority of which arise from tobacco use, are becoming increasingly common. Patients with HNC have poor response to available therapies and high mortality rates. The body’s immune system plays an integral part in killing cancer cells: increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating immune cells has been reported to correlate with better cancer prognosis. Boosting the immune response has thus been a considerable focus of cancer treatment strategies. However, the effectiveness of immune-boosting therapies in HNC remains unexpectedly low, highlighting the need for a better understanding of immune-tumor interactions in order to improve the treatment of HNC. In recent years, immunologists have gained insight into a subset of immune cells termed “tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells,” or “TRM” for short. Compared to other immune cell types, TRM possess a distinctive ability to surveil tissues and quickly respond to threats of infection and cancer growth. The robust function of TRM in tissues is thought to underlie improved patient outcomes in many cancer types such as colorectal, breast, and lung cancers. What is known about TRM mostly stem from studies in mouse models of infection and less so models of cancer. Furthermore, while TRM in many different organs have been investigated, our knowledge of the characteristics and function of TRM in head and neck tissues remain severely limited. Because of their unique protective capabilities, improving our understanding of basic TRM biology in the context of HNC potentiates new targets for boosting antitumor immunity for cancer treatment. In this proposal, I will study TRM in a mouse model of tobacco-associated HNC. This mouse HNC model shares 94% genetic similarity with human HNC, making my findings applicable to human disease. I will (1) characterize the properties of TRM in mouse HNC, and evaluate the tumor-fighting abilities of TRM compared to other immune cell types. In light of exploring novel therapeutic targets, I will also (2) identify cellular factors that regulate TRM in mouse HNC. My project provides an opportunity to deepen our understanding of immune cell biology within tumor tissues, uncovering new ways of tackling tobacco-associated HNC to improve patient outcomes.",

Early age and racial/ethnic minority status confer increased risk of using these products along with associated negative health outcomes. Youths are more vulnerable to nicotine addiction following exposure due to an earlier maturation of reward circuitry as compared with inhibitory control circuits in the brain. Furthermore, minority status is associated with the faster transition from initiation of tobacco product use to tobacco dependence. Neural mechanisms likely play a role as causes for these disparities. We propose that there are differences in habenula circuitry between school-aged youth who ultimately go on to use tobacco products compared with those who do not. Racial/ethnic minority status likely modulates possible differences. 
The habenula is a brain region that responds strongly to nicotine in animals and densely expresses the gene most strongly linked to nicotine dependence in humans. It also is implicated more generally in addiction-related behavior and negative affective states. As such, the circuitry of the habenula may have bearing on initiation and transition to heavy use of tobacco products. Yet the human habenula has eluded study because of its size and the difficulty in segmenting it from adjacent structures of the brain. We will use new analytical techniques that make it possible to segment the habenula from surrounding regions in brain scans using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and explore its functional connectivity in relation to vulnerability to tobacco product use during early adolescence. 
We will analyze data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD), which provides longitudinal MRI and smoking-related data from 11,875 children, including subsamples of individuals from different racial/ethnic minority groups. We will assess functional connectivity of the habenula to two targets in the brain: the ventral tegmental area, an important component of the brain’s reward circuitry, and the salience network, which is linked to nicotine dependence. The findings can provide important information about the circuits related to nicotine addiction and disparities in the negative consequences of tobacco product use.",

Alongside these efforts, researchers have also examined harm reduction strategies such as Electronic Nicotine Device Systems (ENDS), which show evidence improving quit rates to help combat the upward trends in tobacco use. Although ENDS can improve quit rates among adults, they are also gaining popularity among youth. The 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) reported that 11.3% of high school and 2.8% of middle school students use ENDS.
Over the past decade, ENDS has sparked a debate among tobacco researchers regarding the benefits versus risks of these products. While ENDS can serve as a harm reduction strategy, they are not an FDA-approved cessation tool and research has shown that these devices contain chemicals that can be harmful to one's health. Upon entering the market, ENDS products targeted young adults with alluring advertisements. Due to the growing concerns about ENDS, California Proposition 56 officially classified ENDS as tobacco products in 2016, subjecting them to all existing tobacco policies.
Although tobacco policies are in place to reduce tobacco use, there is no standardized approach to assess their effectiveness. The American Lung Association (ALA) has developed state tobacco grades that evaluate the enforcement of tobacco policies at the state, city, and county levels. These grades are based on laws related to smoke-free outdoor air, smoke-free housing, reducing the sale of tobacco products, and, more recently, restrictions on flavored tobacco products. However, these grades have not been utilized in any study to assess the effectiveness of tobacco policies. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of tobacco policies among different sociodemographic groups within California's youth.",

Tobacco use is a risk factor for oral cancer, and patients with tobacco-related oral cancer typically exhibit poor responses to current treatments. The challenge in treating tobacco-associated oral cancer lies in the absence of effective treatment options for the tumor and its surrounding immune environment. Our team discovered that the activation of a molecule known as mTOR in oral lesions that precede cancer contributes to their progression to malignancy. This indicates that reducing the activation of mTOR and its molecular network holds promise as a strategy to impede the progression of oral cancer from oral premalignant lesions. Interestingly, our lab showed that metformin, a safe drug used by millions of type 2 diabetes patients, can diminish mTOR activation in oral premalignant lesions and halt their progression to cancer. Based on these findings, our team conducted a Phase 2 trial in individuals with oral premalignant lesions to investigate metformin's potential in preventing oral cancer. The results from this clinical trial suggest that metformin use may reduce cancer progression. Notably, current and former smokers responded more favorably to metformin compared to never smokers. However, we still do not know the factors influencing metformin's efficacy in preventing the progression of oral premalignant lesions to oral cancer. My work will investigate the hypothesis that (1) the specific genetic alterations promoting mTOR activation in oral premalignant lesions and (2) the surrounding immune environment may dictate metformin's sensitivity. We will explore this hypothesis using recently developed mouse models that reflect closely the genetic complexity of tobacco-associated human oral cancer. Subsequently, we will validate our findings with collected information from our cancer prevention trial. By unraveling this knowledge, I aim to identify molecular alterations that can predict clinical responses to metformin and develop new drug combination strategies to enhance metformin’s efficiency. Our collective efforts strive to maximize the therapeutic potential of metformin as a safe, accessible and low-cost drug to reduce oral cancer in tobacco-burdened communities.",

Recurrence of AP is a risk factor for chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Tobacco smoking is a modifiable causal factor in pancreatitis and is commonly overlooked in medical management. Even when offered quit interventions, quit rates among patients are low. Pancreatitis causes intense pain, and patients report reliance on smoking and other substances for pain relief. Nicotine replacement to quit smoking is questioned based on evidence that nicotine itself may increase AP risk. Despite the unique and important need for pancreatitis patients to stop smoking, no tailored guidelines or tools are available for them. Given the rising rates of cannabis-induced pancreatitis, understanding how cannabis use (alone or combined with tobacco) impacts tobacco quitting behaviors is a major knowledge gap for this patient group. To better understand tobacco and cannabis behaviors in pancreatitis patients, with the long-term goal of developing more effective smoking cessation strategies for this population, we will investigate tobacco and cannabis use in one of the largest studies of pancreatitis patients being followed for recurrence. We will examine how tobacco and cannabis use impact the recurrence of AP. In addition, we will conduct a qualitative study of 30 participants to gain deeper insight into the tobacco use behaviors in the population, including awareness of the associated risk for recurrent disease and probing the role of stress and pain in use and quit behavior. The combined results will guide the design of interventional strategies to reduce tobacco and/or cannabis smoking in pancreatitis patients. Completion of the mentored research will provide a better understanding of the patterns of cannabis and tobacco use in pancreatitis patients and prepare the Principal Investigator with the skills needed to carry out research on tobacco-related disorders, including research design, synthesis of evidence, statistical analysis, interpretation and communication of findings, and research management. In turn, the project will propel her to become a leader in tobacco research and focus on developing more effective and tailored smoking cessation interventions to reduce the harms attributed to tobacco.",

Over the past year, scientists have worked hard to identify and categorize gene changes, known as mutations, in lung cancer patients. Understanding these mutations is crucial because they are often the starting point for cancer; they can turn normal cells into cancer cells by disrupting normal cell functions. Although we've found many mutations, understanding what each mutated gene does is still a challenge. This is because each tumor can have hundreds or thousands of different mutations, making it difficult to pinpoint which ones are critical. To tackle these challenges, we will take an innovative approach. we plan to use advanced gene-editing tools and detailed experiments to build a detailed map of how genes affect lung cancer development, specifically lung adenocarcinoma, a common type of lung cancer. Our research will focus on testing the roles of the 10,000 most active genes in a special breed of mice that have lung cancer driven by a specific gene change known as oncogenic KRAS. We aim to understand how some genes help stop tumors from growing and how others are essential for the tumor’s survival, which might become targets for new cancer drugs. This large-scale study will allow us to explore these genes' roles thoroughly and could lead to breakthroughs in how we understand and treat lung cancer. The insights gained could reveal how tumors start and grow, providing valuable information for developing better treatment strategies.",

National surveys estimate that over 2.5 million middle and high school students are currently using e-cigarettes. High rates of adolescent e-cigarette use are concerning given documented health harms from e-cigarette use to adolescents’ heart, lungs, and brain. Health risks associated with adolescent e-cigarette use have prompted the development of prevention programs designed to reduce adolescent e-cigarette initiation and use. Though most prevention programs are designed for implementation in school settings, parents can also play an important role in preventing their adolescents’ general tobacco use through setting clear expectations and discussing health risks. However, many parents lack knowledge of e-cigarettes and their health harms, especially since e-cigarette designs, ingredients, and health harms change frequently. Parents’ poor knowledge and misperceptions regarding e-cigarettes are likely to undermine their efforts to proactively discuss e-cigarettes with their adolescents and prevent their initiation and use. Notably, there is a lack of up-to-date e-cigarette prevention programs designed for use by parents with their adolescents. To develop such programs, more research is required to assess parents’ knowledge and perceptions regarding e-cigarette products, and to determine the prevention content, messages, communication strategies, format, and resources that would be most beneficial to parents. To address these gaps, we will conduct surveys and focus groups with parents to assess their e-cigarette knowledge, perceptions, household rules about use, and communication strategies. We will also assess their needs and preferences for a parent-based e-cigarette prevention toolkit. Data collected will provide new insights into parent perspectives on adolescent e-cigarette use, and inform the development of a parent-based e-cigarette prevention program.",

They come in a variety of enticing flavors, including marijuana. Strikingly, some e-cigarettes contain new compounds designed to heighten the sensory experience or market health benefits like better sleep and reduced inflammation. However, these products may have unknown health risks due to the compounds used, such as hexahydrocannabinol HHC for its stimulating effects or cannabinol (CBN) for its supposed medicinal properties.
This project aims to bring clarity to this issue by studying the possible heart-related health effects of these compounds. I will generate stem cells from a variety of healthy individuals, which will then be used to create cell populations resembling important heart cells. I will then expose these cell groups to the e-cigarette compounds HHC, CBN, and a conventional compound, tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), to see how they may affect the heart.
By exploring how different heart cells interact when exposed to these compounds, we can better understand the potential effects of e-cigarettes on the heart. The knowledge we gain will then be expanded on using animal models and a smoking machine, which imitates the human consumption of e-cigarettes. This will enable us to more accurately determine the compounds' short- and long-term effects on heart health.

The majority of smokers report a desire to quit smoking; however only 3-5% of unaided quit attempts are successful. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation increases odds of abstinence, but the current FDA-approved options are associated with modest long-term quit rates that rarely exceed 30%. Furthermore, these medications are often accompanied by adverse events that deter utilization. There is a pressing need for alternative smoking cessation medications. A recent phase 3 clinical trial found cytisinicline, a naturally occurring plant-based alkaloid, to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated pharmacotherapy to promote smoking cessation. Unlike the current FDA-approved pharmacotherapies, cytisinicline is widely accessible and cost-effective. Despite promising clinical findings, cytisinicline’s effects on the human brain are unknown.
The objective of this TRDRP postdoctoral application is to advance the neuroscience of nicotine addiction treatment and medication development for smoking cessation. I will use neuroimaging and daily diary self-report assessments to examine cytisinicline’s effects on the human brain and test the brain processes that underlie variability in cytisinicline response. 34 adult daily smokers (50% female) will complete a randomized, within-subject, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled laboratory study of cytisinicline. Specifically, participants will complete two 7-day outpatient protocols that include taking cytisinicline (3 mg, 3 times daily) or placebo, and completing daily diary self-reports of cigarette craving and reward. On day 7, participants will complete a cigarette cue-exposure task during fMRI. 
Specific aims are to test (1) the effects of cytisinicline on neural reward signal to cigarette cues, (2) the effects of cytisinicline on smoking subjective effects, including (a) cigarette craving and (b) reward, and (3) the neural processes that predict variability in response to cytisinicline (i.e., craving and reward). The execution of this project will (a) identify the neural mechanisms underlying cytisinicline’s actions as a smoking cessation treatment and variability in cytisinicline response; and (b) foster my scientific development as an independent clinical neuroscientist with a focus on tobacco use disorder.",

There is no cure for COPD, therefore treatment focuses on alleviating patient symptoms. One of the most common symptoms reported by COPD patients is exercise intolerance. However, in COPD patients the standard measure of exercise intolerance (V̇O2peak) is poorly related to the severity of the decline in lung function. Therefore, although COPD is a ‘lung disease’, this well-appreciated finding affirms that leg muscle dysfunction also contributes to exercise intolerance in COPD patients. We have developed a new exercise test that adds the assessment of leg muscle performance to a standard test that measures V̇O2peak. This allows us to identify whether the “legs” or the “lungs” limit exercise tolerance. This test can also characterize how quickly leg muscle performance declines during an exercise test. Preliminary data, in healthy people, shows that leg muscle performance primarily limits exercise tolerance. However, in COPD patients the reserve in leg muscle performance at the point of exercise intolerance can be substantial. Moreover, the muscles that support breathing can also be dysfunctional in patients with COPD. It has been proposed that signals from these breathing muscles to the brain can result in exercise intolerance before the limits of leg muscle performance are reached. However, it is unclear how leg muscle performance declines during an exercise test in COPD patients. It is also unclear how breathing muscle dysfunction affects the decline in leg muscle performance and exercise tolerance in COPD patients. This project will 1. Characterize the decline in leg muscle performance during exercise and 2. Investigate how adding or reducing the work done by the breathing muscles affects the decline in leg muscle performance. These data will significantly advance our knowledge of the basic mechanisms of exercise intolerance in COPD and our understanding of how breathing muscle dysfunction affects the decline in leg muscle performance and exercise tolerance. This knowledge is essential for understanding how best to design effective treatment strategies to alleviate symptoms in COPD patients.",

These cancers are significant contributors to cancer-related deaths and are among the most common cancers worldwide. While treatments for these cancers have improved, there is still a need for better therapies to help patients live longer and improve their quality of life.
A recent breakthrough in cancer treatment involves a new method called lysosome-targeted chimera (LYTAC), which was reported in the journal Nature by Carolyn Bertozzi’s research group. LYTAC targets proteins that promote cancer growth to either degrade or remove them. They've successfully tested this approach on several cancer-promoting proteins in cells, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, before this method can be used in clinics, its effectiveness in activating the immune system and controlling tumor growth in different animal models needs to be thoroughly tested.
Our research has focused on a protein called galectin-1 (Gal-1), which is found in high levels in HNC and NSCLC. Gal-1 suppresses the immune system in cancer by binding to receptors on immune cells, leading to the death of anticancer T cells, promoting cancer-supporting T cells, and attracting immune-suppressing cells into tumors. Despite its potential as a target for immunotherapy, there is currently no effective treatment targeting Gal-1 available.
In collaboration with Bertozzi’s group, we've developed the first LYTAC degrader called G-M6Pn, which can degrade Gal-1 in human HNC cells. Our study aims to investigate the effects of G-M6Pn on NSCLC cells and its ability to activate key immune cells, control tumor growth and metastasis, and improve survival rates in animal models by eliminating Gal-1. We also plan to explore how G-M6Pn can enhance tumor-killing immune responses when combined with radiotherapy in animal models. We hope that this research will lay the groundwork for using LYTAC degraders to improve the treatment outcomes of tobacco-related cancers in the future.",

Among lung cancer subtypes, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common one and a leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Smoking tobacco is a major cause of lung cancer, which is responsible for approximately 90% of all cases. Tobacco-derived carcinogens induce mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, thereby triggering the transformation of normal lung cells to cancer cells. Among the susceptible genes, TP53, an essential tumour suppressor gene, is one of the most mutated genes in LUAD, with alterations in ~50% of LUAD. Mutations in TP53 are also associated with poor prognosis of lung cancer patients, indicating the critical roles of TP53 in restraining LUAD development and malignant transformation. P53 is a transcriptional activator protein that induces expression of a host of downstream target genes. Despite the crucial roles of TP53 in suppressing lung cancer initiation and progression, however, the underlying mechanisms by which p53 acts remain uncompletely understood.
LUAD arises in the gas-exchange region of the lung, the alveoli, from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, cuboidal cells that secrete pulmonary surfactants and serve as a stem cells pools for generating additional AT2 cells and for differentiation into thin and quiescent alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells which mediate gas exchange. During lung injury repair, AT2 cells are activated to proliferate and form cells known as transitional cells, which eventually differentiate into AT1 cells. Importantly, our recent studies in mouse models revealed that p53 is activated in transitional cells during injury repair and in response to oncogenic insults in the lung. We showed further that p53 inactivation prevents transitional cells from becoming AT1 cells in LUAD and in tissue regeneration after injury. Our findings suggest that p53 restricts LUAD by promoting an AT1 differentiation gene expression program, but the genes required for p53 to induce AT1 differentiation are unknown. In addition, whether AT1 differentiation is critical for p53-mediated tumor suppression is unclear. Our experiments will address these two questions. Achieving these goals will shed light on mechanisms of p53 action in suppressing LUAD development, thereby opening new opportunities for lung cancer prevention and treatment.",

With the rising use of e-cigarettes across different age groups and the legalization of cannabis in many U.S. states, it has become crucial to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of nicotine and cannabinoid co-exposure on neural development and function. Maintaining proper placental development and function is vital for a healthy pregnancy and the well-being of the developing fetus. Any factors influencing placental maturation can potentially disrupt fetal growth and development. Both nicotine and delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) found in cannabis can cross the placenta and blood-brain barrier, concentrating in fetal blood and amniotic fluid.
The primary objective of this research is to explore the effects of nicotine and cannabinoid co-exposure during pregnancy on communication between the placenta and fetus, neural development and cognitive flexibility. To achieve this, the proposed studies will systematically investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to vaped e-cigarette nicotine and THC on the molecular extracellular mechanism between the placenta and fetus, as well as its genetic implications. To study these effects, a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches will be utilized, focusing on how vapor co-exposure of nicotine and THC during pregnancy influences extracellular communication in the placenta-fetus axis, potentially altering extracellular vesicles (EV) cargo and increasing vulnerability to cognitive flexibility in adolescent rats.
The data obtained from this study will significantly contribute to our fundamental knowledge of how prenatal drug exposure affects the critical placenta-fetus communication mechanism neural function and cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, the findings could inform the development of public policies aimed at educating pregnant women about the impact of drug exposure on the developing fetus. Additionally, the research outcomes will enhance our understanding of the genetic and behavioral profiles of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, potentially leading to novel therapeutic approaches.",

Tobacco induced cancer develops with unique alterations in a carbohydrate (or “sugar”) layer of molecules on the tumor-cell surface known as the glycocalyx. In discovery work, we found that applying an external “pulsed” magnetic field to lung cancer cells may induce novel electric forces (EMFs) that engage with charged sugars uniquely enriched on the glycocalyx of the cancer cells, inducing tumor-cell leak and reduced tumor cell viability. The pulsed fields appear to engage with tumor glycans to disrupt the integrity of the tumor cell’s surface or membrane. Such unique sugars are expressed heavily on the glycocalyx of lung tumors, and might thus represent a novel “Achilles heel” or vulnerability of lung cancer cells to treatment using pulsed magnetic fields, while normal cells appear to be spared in studies thus far. Biophysical approaches to target lung cancer remain under-explored, and we aim to study how pulsed magnetic fields target lung cancer cell systems, including pilot work to inhibit the growth of tobacco-induced model human lung tumors in mice. This may facilitate novel therapeutic approaches to eradicate tumor cells without classical radiation or chemotherapy that can damage normal surrounding body cells. We hypothesize that EMFs generated by pulsed magnetic fields can: (1) engage with unique “charged glycan” arrays on the glycocalyx of tobacco induced lung cancer cells to disrupt tumor membrane integrity, and (2) inhibit cancer-cell viability in human lung tumor models growing in mice treated with short exposures to the novel pulsed fields. Lung cancer recurs frequently, and non-toxic strategies to cure micro-metastatic disease are needed. Applying pulsed magnetic fields in a treatment setting may potentially eradicate “visible and invisible” tumor with high impact. In addition, proposed pilot studies will inform the specific impact on tobacco-induced lung cancers, including any unique susceptibility of their glycocalyx to pulsed fields. Finally, we have an eye to the fact that the cancer glycocalyx is known to augment a cancer’s invasive potential, so the use of pulsed fields to target glycocalyx-rich tumor cells may uniquely eradicate highly invasive tumor cell subsets to further improve outcomes.",

Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer and is heavy associated with smoking. Lung adenocarcinoma can metastasize to many different organs, including the liver, brain, and back to the lung. 

Many different genes are mutated in lung adenocarcinoma in different patients. The collection of genes that are mutated in a tumor is called the tumor “genotype"". Despite this diversity of genes mutated in lung adenocarcinoma the contribution of the tumor genotype to metastatic ability remains largely unexplored. To determine the extent that genotype drives different aspect of metastasis, we will integrate cutting-edge multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 somatic genome editing and tumor barcoding with in vivo metastases assays. This will uncover which genotypes drive metastatic ability across different organ sites. Understanding how tumor genotype influences metastatic ability could have prognostic implications and ultimately uncover targetable pro-metastatic pathways.

Primary tumors often create an immunosuppressive environment, however when cancers try to metastasize to other organs the cancer cells are re-exposed to immune detection. Thus, metastatic cancer cells likely possess or acquire specific adaptations. While some tumor genotypes have been suggested to reduce anti-cancer immune responses, understanding the extent to which genotype contributes to immune evasion has implication for immunotherapy treatment of lung cancer patients. By quantifying the impact of genotype on the ability of metastases to seed and grow at different sites, we will uncover genotypes that enable lung cancer cells to evade immune destruction at some of all distant sites. 

For the past decade my laboratory has been dedicated to studying lung cancer. We have investigated lung cancer metastasis and developed new methods to better uncover how genotype impact different clinically relevant aspects of lung cancer. We are excited about the proposed studies because they are unique from what others in the field are doing and have the potential to establish a new paradigm of how lung cancer gains that ability to spread throughout the body.",

Smoking is the most important risk factor for adverse outcomes during and after surgery. Rates of smoking at the time of surgery are high, 22.3-43.0%, particularly among Veterans and people with health disparities. Smoking at the time of surgery is associated with complications, reoperations, and mortality. Despite these risks, smoking cessation treatment is often not integrated into surgical care.

CM promotes smoking cessation by providing financial rewards for quitting. CM for smoking cessation has been shown to improve quit rates, but studies reveal that CM is most likely to work when tailored for the patient population. CM for smoking cessation has never been conducted before and after major surgery. Advances in mobile technology allow for remote (mobile) monitoring of carbon monoxide (CO) to confirm smoking abstinence for outpatients receiving CM.

We will develop the first-of-its-kind mobile CM smoking cessation protocol for Veterans undergoing major elective surgery. We will consult with a Community Advisory Panel of Veteran patient advocates and content experts on CM, surgery, and VA healthcare policy about methods for CM delivery. The panel will advise on timing and approach of CM for VA surgery patients. 

In a 5-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will randomly assign 36 Veteran smokers undergoing major elective surgery to receive 5 weeks of CM with mobile CO monitoring or treatment as usual (TAU), referral to a VA smoking cessation clinic and quitline. Both groups will receive smoking cessation medication. We will measure feasibility of smoking cessation CM at the time of surgery by tracking recruitment, engagement, and retention in the study.  We will also assess the effect of CM compared to TAU on smoking cessation outcomes, including quit attempts; cigarettes per day; nicotine dependence; and quit rates. This innovative study is the first to deliver CM before and after major surgery, and targets a high-priority California tobacco population, military Veterans. Results will inform treatment for other high-risk surgical populations. Findings will be used to apply for VA Merit funding to conduct an RCT examining the effect of CM on smoking outcomes among Veteran smokers undergoing surgery.",

Pulmonary arteries, covered by a thin layer of endothelial cells, carry blood from the heart to the lung for oxygen. New evidence indicates that endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary arteries contributes to PH. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. We and others reported that miR-483 promotes a healthy pulmonary endothelium, and decreased levels of miR-483 lead to endothelial dysfunction. In relation to CS-induced lung injury, miR-483 can convert to its oxidized form, namely, oxidized miR-483 under harmful conditions such as CS. Consequently, this change aggravates PH. In this study, we will use cultured lung endothelial cells and animal CS models to investigate the mechanism by which CS induces miR-483 oxidation.

However, their interactions in caries development and the influence of Ss on the Sm-Ca relationship are unclear. 

Recent studies have shown that pure nicotine (N) can stimulate the cooperative relationship between Sm and Ca and increase the growth of Sm when grown together with Ss. Although there are indications that N has an enhanced effect on causing dental caries, most research studies have focused on N instead of nicotine vape aerosols (N-VA) produced by e-cigarettes. Additionally, very limited studies have been conducted on the effect of N-VA on Sm, Ss, and Ca. Our previous study and supporting data for this study showed that at the same nicotine content, the response of Sm and Ca to N was different from N-VA, which led us to hypothesize that nicotine vape aerosol affects the dynamic relationship between Sm, Ca, and Ss and potentially impacts dental caries disease differently than pure nicotine.

In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effect of N-VA on the Sm-Ss-Ca relationship compared to N using a well-characterized bacteria line to evaluate co-adhesion, biofilm formation, sugar-based substances produced by bacteria, acid production, and transcriptome (gene expression). In Aim 2, we will study the effect of N-VA on the impact of Ss on the Sm-Ca relationship and dental caries-causing activity. Findings will contribute to the understanding of the effect of N-VA on the interactions between Sm, Ss, and Ca compared to N and will be critical for understanding the role of these microorganisms in the reported significantly elevated caries prevalence in nicotine vapers, especially in adolescents and young adults.",

It increases the risk of atherosclerosis which causes plaque to build up in artery walls, including those which supply heart muscle. When plaque narrows vessels in the heart, it can restrict blood flow to the heart and lead to angina (chest pain) when the oxygen requirements of the heart outstrip that supplied by the blood vessels. In addition, when a plaque ruptures, it can trigger a blood clot to be formed, leading to total occlusion of a coronary (heart) vessel, causing a heart attack, known as a myocardial infarction (MI). With MI, irreversible death of heart muscle cells occurs, and also heart rhythm can be so disturbed that the heart cannot pump adequately, often leading to sudden and immediate death. Therefore, finding new ways to protect the heart from decreased blood flow will help patients suffering from tobacco-related coronary heart disease. 
Mitochondria, which are small organelles inside heart muscle cells, are responsible for energy production that is essential for normal heart function. When mitochondrial function is disturbed, it can exacerbate heart muscle cell death. Emerging evidence shows that reduced blood supply (ischemia) can cause mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to heart muscle cell death and heart dysfunction. In the proposed project, we will study the role of Perm1, a novel mitochondrial regulator, in ischemic injury using genetically engineered mouse models. Our hypothesis is that the Perm1 protein protects heart muscle cells from the damage they can incur with decreased blood supply. By using gene manipulations, we have made mice with increased and decreased Perm1 expression in the heart. We will use these mice to study the function of Perm1 in the heart. In addition, we will also study the potential mechanism(s) by which Perm1 protects the heart from the damage caused by a decreased blood supply. Long range, we hope our research will lead to identification of potential therapeutic target(s) for treating the consequences of tobacco or tobacco-related product-induced coronary artery disease and resultant heart disease.",

IPF patients survive for only about 3-5 years. To date, the exact cause of the IPF is unclear but cigarette smoking (CS) is believed is one of the risks. CS causes the damage of alveolar epithelial cell (cells that line air sac), which produce the scar-promoting molecule leading to IPF. One of the damages the CS induced is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (a place where protein is produced) stress, which is known to play pivotal roles in the development of IPF. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is a protein that induce cell death when cells response to ER stress. We have reported that ER stress induced by loss of a protein called GRP78 in alveolar epithelial cell can lead to lung fibrosis in a mouse model called Grp78 knockout (KO) mice. Our preliminary data in Grp78/Chop double KO mice further demonstrated that CHOP is a key factor involved in the development of lung fibrosis. We also observed CS exposure increased CHOP expression and lung fibrosis in the slices of Grp78 KO and IPF lung culture. These data lead us to study a hypothesize that CS worsen the damage of alveolar epithelial cell and lung fibrosis through the induction of much severer ER stress, with a specific emphasis on CHOP.

To validate this hypothesis, we will: 1) Explore whether CS worsen AT2 damage and lung fibrosis through CHOP using AT2 cells and lungs from Grp78 KO and Grp78/CHOP double KO mice, as well as from IPF patients and normal donors who are smokers and non-smokers. 2) Identify new factors contributing to CS-induced AEC damage and lung fibrosis using techniques such as RNA sequencing and ATAC-Sequencing on AT2 cells from IPF patients and normal donors who are smokers and non-smokers.",

This burden is disproportionately felt by underrepresented minorities, people with lower education and income, and individuals with behavioral health conditions. Motivational interviewing (MI) successfully enhances patients’ motivation to quit smoking by evoking their ambivalence about quitting. Although MI works, it can be time intensive, require substantial expertise, and patients still need tailored referrals to smoking cessation programs that fit their needs, social circumstances, and resources. Using the latest in artificial intelligence (AI), digital assistants that assess readiness, delivery quality MI, and make tailored referrals to cessation treatment programs could provide an effective and efficient way to prevent smoking-related illnesses and death. 

This proposal evaluates a pilot-tested chatbot that delivers an MI-based intervention to assess and promote readiness to quit then creates a detailed, tailored quit plan including education about quit tools. Our pilot study showed that our research protocol was acceptable and verified that even smokers not interested in quitting were willing to use the chatbot. Many smokers (in both the intervention and control groups) were willing to make a quit attempt but the pilot was not powered to test any hypotheses. The chatbot architecture and machine learning models functioned well enough to deliver quality MI and successfully tailor referrals. We propose to first improve the chatbot functionality by incorporating recent advances in AI language models (e.g. ChatGPT-4), adding interventions to build patient confidence in their cessation plan, provide great support and follow-up both before and after a quit-date, link patients with a prescriber if pharmacotherapy is needed, and to improve the quit plan tailoring process by expanding the assessment of social needs. This optimized chatbot will then by evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial comparing smokers who use the chatbot with those in usual care. Our primary outcome will be biochemically-verified smoking cessation at 6 months and we will also be assessing other changes such as improved motivation or readiness to quit, self-confidence in quitting, and use of other nicotine products.",

Regulation of drug-induced behaviors via translated small open reading frames (smORFs) has been overlooked in addiction neuroscience. We have identified a 3' untranslated region (UTR) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the alpha(α)6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit (encoded by the CHRNA6 gene) that appears to regulate nicotine addiction. Our data show that this SNP leads to a two-fold increase in nicotine seeking and substance use in rodents and humans, respectively. The results are unique as studies in the field thus far have focused on SNPs in the coding regions of the genome. Our laboratory has engineered a CHRNA6 3' UTRC123G SNP mutant rat line that replicates the genetic variation in humans in order to functionally validate the mechanisms of enhanced nicotine use. We have introduced the entire human 3' UTR, with the 'C' to 'G' single nucleotide change in the 123 position in Sprague Dawley rats (α6CC and α6GG-carriers), thereby enhancing the animal model's translational significance to humans. We will test the hypothesis that the α6 3' UTR SNP regulates nicotine-induced effects on the brain and behavior in an age-dependent manner via changes in gene or protein expression in ventral tegmental area (VTA)-Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) brain reward neurons. By providing a new conceptual framework for how 3' UTR genetic human polymorphisms regulate drug-induced brain effects, our approaches could uncover new proteins in addiction. Our studies may significantly influence the field, as we aim to discover targeted gene or other 3' UTR regulatory mechanisms mediating sex- and genotype-dependent effects in addiction. The mechanisms found to regulate age-, genotype- and sex-dependent effects could then be targeted. Such work on the α6 3' UTR SNP could lead to future high throughput screening strategies with the ability to translate genomic sequence into drug therapeutics for nicotine use cessation. Overall, our studies have potential impacts in nAChR biology, addiction neuroscience, and drug discovery. This is significant given the exponential increase in adolescent electronic nicotine and poly-drug use, necessitating improved prevention / intervention strategies.",

However, the potential health implications of vaping for pregnant women and their fetuses remain largely unknown. Moreover, it is unknown if and how this adverse effect on the unborn babies will persist into their postnatal and adulthood. To tackle this health issue, we propose this project. The rigor of this proposal is based on prior studies that e-cig products exert more pronounced toxic effects on embryonic cells compared to their adult counterparts, culminating in fetal growth restriction. This suggests a distinctive vulnerability of the developing fetus to e-cig-induced toxicity. Recently, we have developed a pregnant rat model of e-cig exposure. Our preliminary data unveiled a link between e-cig exposure and amplified ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced heart injury and subsequent heart failure in adult offspring associated with alterations in cardiomyopathy and ischemia-sensitive markers. Building upon these pivotal findings, we hypothesize that prenatal e-cig exposure engenders modifications in fetal cardiac genes via an epigenetic mechanism, thus perpetuating into adulthood and instigating a dysfunctional cardiac phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we first will determine if fetal e-cig exposure causes heart dysfunction in adult offspring. Then, we aim to pinpoint cardiac dysfunctional markers specifically associated with e-cig exposure. Additionally, we will ascertain the epigenetic marker responsible for regulating cardiac fetal gene expression, specifically focusing on FTO/m6A RNA methylation. Finally, we will employ pharmacological and gene therapeutic interventions to gauge if restoring FTO-dependent m6A methylation ameliorates the e-cig-induced heart dysfunction phenotype. We expect that e-cig exposure induces FTO-dependent M6A hypermethylation, leading to alterations to cardiac ischemia-sensitive biomarkers and signaling networks within the developing heart, which persists into adulthood and develops a heart dysfunction phenotype. Our findings will provide novel evidence for the regulatory authority to warn the public that pregnant women and their unborn babies are vulnerable populations for e-cig exposure. Once the unborn babies are exposed to e-cig vaping in pregnancy, they are predisposed to cardiovascular disease in later life.",

Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the optic nerve. Without timely treatment, it worsens and you will lose peripheral vision. Glaucoma is more common and more severe among Black/African American individuals. Although high eye pressure is the main reason for optic nerve damage, many studies have shown that the blood supply to the eye is also involved in the development and worsening of glaucoma. Age-related macular degeneration is a condition that affects the macula, which is the part of your eye responsible for giving you clear central vision. With AMD, patients can lose central vision, making it difficult to see things clearly or do everyday tasks.
Our prior research from TRDRP Pilot Award showed that the more someone smokes, the higher their chances of their glaucoma becoming worse. We discovered that stopping smoking can be helpful to halt glaucoma worsening in heavy smokers.
We aim to understand how stopping smoking may lower the risk of eye diseases in diverse populations. To do this, we will use a lot of information from many people collected all over the country. We will confirm that taking care of your eyes and living a healthy lifestyle and stopping smoking can also help reduce the risk of developing glaucoma and AMD or worsening their effect on vision. This will be helpful for improving treatment recommendations to slow down glaucoma and AMD and ultimately prevent blindness.",

California has the highest rates of homelessness in the U.S., with 171,521 PEH on any given day, which is about one-fifths of the nation’s PEH. About half of the population experiencing homelessness in California resides in Los Angeles and San Francisco counties, the two counties that are the focus of this proposal. A 2023 study on California homelessness confirmed the high rates of cigarette smoking among PEH—70% among PEH compared to 6.2% in California and 11% nationally. PEH have lower rates of successful cessation than the general population, despite making similar number of quit attempts. To address these gaps, we conducted a pilot intervention using an innovative model leveraging community pharmacists to provide one-time tobacco treatment using the 5As (Ask, Advice, Assess, Assist and Arrange) model and arranged for monthly delivery of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for 3 months (“pharm-only”) to PEH staying in a homeless shelter in San Francisco, CA. The pharm-only intervention reduced consumption and increased quitting behaviors, but participants endorsed long-term behavioral and medication support to quit completely. In this proposal, we build on the 3-month pharm-only intervention by developing a protocol for an Extended Intervention for Tobacco use (EXIT) for PEH that consists of: 1) a single session of pharmacist-delivered 5As and monthly delivery of NRT for 6 months, and 2) health coach-delivered, weekly-to-monthly wellness-focused telephone coaching for 6 months addressing tobacco use within the context of co-occurring psychiatric and substance-use comorbidities. We will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy on tobacco abstinence by conducting a randomized controlled trial of EXIT vs. the pharm-only intervention among 150 PEH staying in transitional shelters or short-term hotels in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California. This proposal is aligned with TRDRP’s priority of social and behavioral prevention and treatment of tobacco use and contributes to the California Endgame Initiative by increasing capacity for tobacco treatment among community-based organizations serving populations experiencing homelessness.",

Approximately 15% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a highly aggressive cancer. SCLC is strikingly associated with tobacco: approximately 95% of SCLC patients have a history of tobacco use, and smoking cessation is currently the most effective primary prevention strategy. However, there are no effective treatments for patients with SCLC, who have an overall 5-year survival rate of <8%.

Previously, SCLC cells were found to be sensitive to small molecule inhibitors that target a family of proteins called poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases (or PARPs) that are involved in DNA repair. While there was a great deal of excitement around the possibility that PARP inhibitors could be effective treatments for SCLC, clinical trials disappointingly demonstrated that this class of inhibitors had only mixed results in patients. Understanding how SCLC resist PARP inhibitors and finding new drugs that overcome this resistance could greatly benefit patients with SCLC, who urgently need more effective treatment options.

Genome-scale screens have recently identified a helicase (an enzyme that unwinds DNA) as a key driver of resistance to PARP inhibition. As such, drugging this helicase may boost the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors in SCLC. However, helicases in general have been difficult to drug, and there are no FDA-approved helicase inhibitors for cancer. To overcome this, we recently discovered small molecules that induce the degradation of this helicase and found that this could sensitize SCLC cells to PARP inhibition in cell culture models. Here, we propose to optimize our lead compounds so that they are suitable for use in mouse models of SCLC. 

If successful, we will have identified a novel therapeutic target for overcoming resistance to PARP inhibitors in SCLC. Moreover, we will have demonstrated that it is druggable, and our optimized compound will be poised for rapid development for future clinical studies. The proposed studies could lead to safer and more effective treatments for patients with SCLC, a cancer highly associated with tobacco use.",

Despite many parents having smoke-free homes, fewer enforce vape-free policies. Active tobacco use and passive tobacco exposure pose health risks to kids. However, the full manifestation of diseases takes time. Hence, healthcare costs related to tobacco use and secondhand exposure among kids might not fully capture the short-run economic impact. Tobacco use and secondhand exposure are more likely to lead to kids missing school (absenteeism) and having behavior/learning problems. Research has found that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder resulting from secondhand smoke exposure imposes a burden on schools four times greater than on the healthcare system. 
Tobacco use and secondhand exposure among kids will impact schools in various ways, including funding losses due to absenteeism, increased costs associated with addressing and reducing tobacco use, counseling for behavioral issues related to tobacco use, and managing hazardous tobacco product waste. School resource reduction can jeopardize educational quality, potentially exacerbating tobacco-related disparities. Unfortunately, little scientific attention has been given to schools' financial burdens in this context.
Our study delves into the school costs attributable to youth tobacco use (ages 12-17) and secondhand exposure in children (ages 6-11) at home. Given the popularity of cannabis use among California youth and the similar but unknown effects of cannabis use on school funding loss from absenteeism and school costs, we will also consider the impacts of youth cannabis use for a more comprehensive analysis. We will estimate California annual school funding losses from absenteeism associated with the use of e-cigarettes, combustible tobacco, cannabis for youth, and secondhand tobacco exposure at home for children. We will also examine the disparities in funding losses by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and rural/urban residency. Lastly, we will estimate the economic impact of youth tobacco and cannabis use on school costs, considering costs related to waste management, support programs, and monitoring efforts and comparing these costs across urban and rural schools.  
The findings of our study will help conduct impact evaluations of the state and local tobacco control policies, informing effective decisions for advancing the tobacco endgame strategy.",

Over the past several years, we and others have unfortunately found that chronic use of e-cigarette tobacco products is not without risk, with detrimental alterations in inflammation, physiology, and immune function. Most recently, in a pilot study utilizing human subjects recruited in 2017, we found significant pulmonary and systemic inflammatory and innate immune (neutrophil and monocyte) changes in e-cigarette users. These findings support our hypothesis that chronic use of e-cigarettes will lead to both lung and systemic inflammation and downstream diseases, and thus propagate tobacco related diseases. In this proposal we leverage airway and blood samples obtained from human subjects recruited via our TRDRP High Impact Pilot Award and Supplement (2019-2022) to define the inflammatory changes and immunomodulation caused by chronic use of 4th generation, high-nicotine, pod-based e-cigarettes. Further, our survey-based studies and recruitment of human subjects have both found a high rate of dual use of nicotine e-cigarettes with inhaled forms of cannabis, particularly vaped tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These patterns of dual use (THC + nicotine vaping) are even higher in populations disproportionally affected by tobacco, including Hispanics, American Indians, and Black Americans. For the work proposed, we will leverage blood and sputum samples collected from a cohort of dual users of nicotine e-cigarettes and THC vape devices, plus a cohort of THC-only vapers, to assess for additive or synergistic effects of pulmonary and systemic inflammation, and on circulating host immune cell phenotypes. The data generated from the proposed aims will increase our understanding of tobacco-related diseases which will arise from long-term use of e-cigarettes, both those containing nicotine and those containing THC.",

Patients with these tumors have few therapeutic options and very poor survival. We found that these lung carcinomas are highly sensitive to an experimental drug (PCLX-001) that is currently in clinical trial for lymphoma. We investigated the molecular mechanism by which KRAS, LKB1 and KEAP1 mutant cells are sensitive to this drug and found a mitochondrial protein that is essential for the viability of these tumors.

In California, 18% of high school students used electronic vapor products on at least one day in the past 30 days. Exposure to social media advertising is associated with e-cigarette use among youth. Social media influencers are regarded as more trusted and authentic than traditional advertising. We identified engaging micro-influencers (users with 1,000-100,000+) followers who promote e-cigarettes. Some of these influencers are based in California. Their posts frequently have non-compliant disclosures of partnerships with tobacco brands and/or lack the FDA-required nicotine warning labels and age restrictions, in violation of the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) marketing restrictions. Influencers who promote e-cigarettes also use audio-visual effects in promotional pots, including stylization of influencers to look young, use of popular songs, autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) sounds or motivational narration and depiction of e-cigarettes in attractive and youth-oriented lifestyle contexts (e.g., healthy lifestyle, technology, gaming). These tactics could diminish adolescents’ harm perceptions of e-cigarettes, contribute to normalization of e-cigarette use, and expose e-cigarette never-users to e-cigarette content. Data from our adolescent surveys and focus groups show that influencers who were perceived as “young-looking,” who showed e-cigarettes as part of their daily life (e.g., using e-cigarettes and exercising) or used novel marketing features like ASMR were considered more relatable compared to influencers who look “older,” who overtly promote e-cigarettes without any non-substance-use context, or who did not use novel marketing features. To understand the impact of these marketing tactics on California youth, the proposed study will conduct randomized online experiments and in-person eye-tracking experiments to analyze the effects of audio-visual components of e-cigarette influencer marketing that could contribute to normalization of e-cigarette use.

Despite tremendous gains in the alcohol literature, little research has investigated the role of parental nicotine use history on level of response to acute nicotine, and whether changes in brain function in response to acute nicotine prior to regular nicotine use and during peak, overlapping periods of neural development and heightened substance use (e.g., ages 18-25), predict important substance use outcomes. The sensitivity model suggests that those who experience greater positive effects from initial experimentation with nicotine are at greater risk for nicotine dependence. However, prospective data examining early-life objective brain-behavior markers to acute nicotine in individuals with and without parental nicotine use histories and its relation to future nicotine use does not exist. Initial response to nicotine (a highly addictive chemical compound) may serve as an early-life vulnerability that could contribute to and predict NTP and other substance use and addiction-related behaviors over time.

Broadly, the aims of the study are to (1) determine whether early-life neurobehavioral and subjective markers are altered by acute nicotine exposure and (2) determine whether level of response to nicotine at ages 18-19 predicts substance-related outcomes 1.5 years later and whether these relationships are moderated by parental history of nicotine use.",

It is known to have a diverse set of predisposing etiologies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Recently, disruption of circadian rhythms, a highly conserved phenomenon in most mammalian tissues and organs, has been linked to inflammation, premature aging, and playing a significant role in the lung health of adults. For example, jet lag and cigarette smoking are known to disrupt clock gene expression; and persons who work irregular hours are more prone to the development of asthma and CLD. However, the role of the molecular clock in the developing lung has remained largely understudied. New evidence suggests that molecular clock expression in the lung is present early in the fetus, making circadian rhythms a potentially highly relevant factor in lung development and later pulmonary morbidity. This is also highly pertinent since smoking during pregnancy and lactation is strongly linked to CLD, however, its impact on clock genes that regulate the circadian rhythm is unknown. Due to the recent increase in the use of electronic cigarettes by pregnant women, this issue has become even more relevant. Using our well-established rat and human lung tissue models and elegant genetic models, we propose to examine the effects of tobacco smoke and nicotine exposure during pregnancy and lactation on the circadian clock genes. In addition, we also propose to examine the effects of a novel class of drugs, i.e., clock gene modulators, known as chronotherapeutics, with the goal to block perinatal smoke exposure and electronic vaping related lung morbidities such as predisposition to asthma, premature aging, and CLD. Despite all efforts, approximately 10% of U.S. women smoke during pregnancy, resulting in at least 450,000 smoke-exposed infants per year, rendering the work proposed here highly pertinent. Given our previous significant contributions to advance the mechanistic understanding of tobacco smoke/nicotine-induced programming of the developing lung, we are confident that the proposed work will not only provide novel therapeutic targets to prevent nicotine-induced CLD but will also significantly advance TRDRP’s mission to end all commercial tobacco products in California by the year 2035.",

Fibrosis is the pathophysiological response to chronic injury resulting in excessive extracellular matrix protein deposition and scarring. In the heart, excessive cardiac fibrosis triggers tissue stiffness, ultimately progressing to heart failure and increasing mortality. Despite the diversity of underlying etiologies that can lead to fibrosis, the common biochemical and cellular mechanism is the transdifferentiation of quiescent fibroblasts to activated myofibroblasts (MyoFB, ACTA2+), which can be stimulated by nicotine. Currently, there is no therapy to target myofibroblast activation for cardiac fibrosis in clinics. Here, I will provide evidence for the antifibrotic effects of a new compound. I will describe the prospective mechanism of action and a drug development plan aiming to treat nicotine-induced fibrogenesis. The approach represents a proof-of-concept of leveraging the human stem cell platform, animal model, and state-of-the-art molecular experiments as a drug development strategy. The compound has the potential to become a novel therapy to treat nicotine-induced fibrogenesis.",

However, certain lifestyle choices like smoking can have detrimental effects on our heart health. Tobacco smoke, for instance, has been extensively studied and is known to harm the heart and blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart diseases. On the other hand, marijuana remains less understood concerning its impact on heart function. 
In this research project, we aim to shed light on how dual tobacco and marijuana smoking affect our vessel function. By investigating the effects of both substances combined, we hope to determine if there are potential risks to the heart and vessels that were previously unknown.
To conduct this clinical study, we will analyze how dual tobacco and marijuana smoking impacts the lining of our blood vessels, known as the endothelium. The endothelium plays a crucial role in regulating blood flow and maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system. We will compare the effects of dual use with those of tobacco-only and marijuana-only use to better understand the unique impact of combining these substances. The heart and vessel function will be studied using an ultrasound machine and electrocardiogram. Additionally, blood samples will be collected from our study participants to study the changes in the blood. 
We anticipate that our study will contribute valuable insights into the effects of dual tobacco and marijuana smoke on heart and vessel health. By revealing the potential risks associated with dual use, we can provide healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public with evidence-based information to promote heart-healthy decisions. 
This project endeavors to address an important knowledge gap regarding the effects of both marijuana and tobacco smoke on the heart and vessel health. By understanding the potential risks of dual use, we hope to foster heart-healthy lifestyles and improve the overall health and well-being of our communities.",

While California (CA) remains a leader of the nation’s tobacco control efforts, an estimated 2.8 million residents continue to smoke. Attractive marketing, high levels of nicotine, and flavoring make tobacco products highly enticing and addictive leading to initiation and prolonged use. To impede smoking-related death and disease, several cigarette-specific federal regulatory actions may be taken, including: 1) banning menthol flavors, 2) reducing nicotine; and 3) requiring graphic health warning labels. Not wishing to wait for federal action, CA began prohibiting the sale of all flavored tobacco products including menthol cigarettes. Considering, “As goes California, so goes the nation”, the tobacco industry attempted to stop CA’s flavor ban but were unsuccessful. As a result, they instead began circumventing the law by developing replacements for flavored products such as ‘non-menthol’ cigarettes and ‘clear’ e-cigarettes, which contain artificial cooling agents that impart a cooling effect but lack a minty odor or flavor.

Given the rise in popularity of e-cigarettes, authorization of heated tobacco products, use of new cooling agents, it is critical to understand how preferences for tobacco products may shift in response to these regulations and industry actions. Several questions are unanswered: Will former menthol smokers’ preferences shift to replacement “non-menthol” cigarettes? Will regulatory actions change smokers’ preferences for non-combusted tobacco products? Will shifts in tobacco product preferences differ among sociodemographic populations, and could this lead to widening health disparities? 

This project will answer these questions by employing a set of experimental tobacco purchase tasks in which smokers’ make hypothetical purchase decisions designed to uncover their preferences for various tobacco products (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, heated tobacco) and their accompanying features (flavors, nicotine, warnings) and determine their willingness to pay (or avoid) such features. We will recruit two cohorts of 1,050 adult daily smokers (2,100 total) aged 18-to-65, surveyed one year apart, to reveal changes in tobacco product preferences. Our findings will help determine any unforeseen impact that regulatory policies may have non-combustible tobacco product use in CA.",

In 2019 approximately 34 million Americans were currently smoking. E-cigarettes (or vape) have been advertised as a healthier substitute to combustible cigarette smoking, but e-cigarette vapor still contains a wide range of deleterious products, including high levels of nicotine. One in five teens regularly engage in vaping, making them far more likely to end up smoking combustible cigarettes than those who have never vaped. Even though e-cigarettes generally contain fewer toxic chemicals compared to the deadly mix of 7,000 chemicals in smoke from combustible cigarettes, studies have shown they are still harmful and toxic. Combustible cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use have been linked to several diseases, including periodontitis. Periodontitis is an oral chronic inflammatory disease that affects approximately half of the US population and can cause irreversible tooth loss. There are studies showing an association between smoking (and e-cigarette use) and periodontitis in humans. However, how smoking and e-cigarette use lead to periodontitis still remain to be completely understood. We have previously shown that molecules from combustible cigarette smoke can stimulate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and facilitate infection in oral cells. Here we propose to investigate the role of AhR activation by combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes on infection with periodontal pathogens, and on innate immune responses against the periodontal pathogens in human oral cells. We will evaluate whether combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes modulate microbial infection in oral cells via AhR activation. We will also examine whether combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes modulate the host response called “inflammasome” to oral microbes in human oral cells via AhR activation. Inflammasomes are a group of proteins that can sense cellular stress or damage and can initiate an inflammatory response. Our findings will help better understand the cellular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of tobacco-related periodontitis. As pharmacological activators and inhibitors of AhR are already being developed, our findings may raise the possibility of targeting AhR therapeutically for treatment of smoking-induced diseases.",

Tobacco dependence is high in the SUD population and treatment increases the likelihood of SUD treatment success. Historically, SUD treatment programs have been reticent to integrate tobacco treatment that ultimately led to recent legislative action in the form of Assembly Bill 541, which mandates screening and tobacco treatment at outpatient treatment facilities. Despite this effort, inpatient touchpoints remain a critical care gap for treating tobacco among patients with SUD.
CA Bridge is a statewide, hospital-based program whose goal is to ensure every hospital in California has the capability to treat SUD. The program advises patients, connects them to inpatient and outpatient treatment, and follows-up after discharge. The CA Bridge SUD program treats opiates and other substances, yet tobacco treatment is not part of the protocol. Given the broad reach of CA Bridge, supplementation of existing inpatient services with tobacco care may prove critical to reduce tobacco use among people with SUD in California, a priority population with a high burden of tobacco use and related disease.
This proposed study will test an intervention to introduce tobacco treatment to patients with SUD admitted to UC Davis Hospital—a CA Bridge program leader. The intervention will compare usual care (UC-TT) with inpatient pharmacist-delivered tobacco treatment (PD-TT); which will offer nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and connect patients to quitline services. This study has two objectives. First, to refine and implement the PD-TT protocols with SUD treatment stakeholders at UC Davis Hospital for patients with SUD. Second, to evaluate implementation by assessing rates of NRT inpatient and at discharge, discharge quitline orders, and connection to quitline services among patients with SUD. The long-term goal of this study is to fill a gap in the continuum of tobacco-related care by providing patients with SUD tobacco treatment in an inpatient setting.",

NCPC is the only tobacco-related research center in California’s San Joaquin Valley (SJV) and serves all eight counties of the Valley, as well as three adjacent counties in the Sierra Foothills. Collectively, these counties represent a region with higher tobacco use, weaker tobacco control policies, and a higher burden of disease and death. Since its inception in 2018, NCPC has established itself as a unifying entity that provides essential support to regional tobacco control programs and community organizations.  Activities within NCPC align with three major goals: a) to generate empirical data focused on SJV, b) disseminate data to community organizations and tobacco/cannabis stakeholders, and c) build the community’s capacity to support, create, and implement evidenced-based tobacco/cannabis prevention and control policies. The current application resubmission describes a revised strategic plan and programmatic goals for NCPC. 

This submission extends the work building on the existing foundation of NCPC.  We incorporate lessons learned in the past four five years, as well as direct community input on regional needs. Specifically, NCPC will respond to community calls for 1) community-level support for tailored tobacco and cannabis prevention and cessation needs unique to SJV and 2) broader community involvement to support tobacco control activities and broaden awareness of California Endgame initiative. Activities include community-academic partnerships in tobacco policy implementation assessments, citizen scientist-led ambulatory data collection and information dissemination, and data dashboards that will be broadly disseminated to communities through infographics, visualized data, video series, and in-person consultations.

Rapid research activities will include SJV-based data dashboard reflecting community partners' existing data collection and analysis of tobacco/nicotine retail environment.

The proposed activities will leverage NCPC’s existing role in the region as a connector between formerly disparate organizations, as well as a key partner in critical research and policy development that will provide data and resources to the San Joaquin Valley and local Sierra Foothills.",
