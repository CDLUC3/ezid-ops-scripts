Organophosphate pesticides (OPs) are the most commonly used insecticides in the U.S., and glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide. The proposed project focuses on identifying biomarkers for exposures to these two types of pesticides. A few studies have shown that exposure to OPs and glyphosates may be associated with increased breast cancer risk in humans and that they increase cell division and disrupt hormone signaling in breast cancer cells and animal models. However, additional studies are needed to determine if exposure to these pesticides increase breast cancer risk in humans. Research question(s) or central hypotheses: We hypothesize that methylation in blood cell DNA is associated with urinary measures of OP and glyphosate exposure, and that some sites of DNA methylation will be identified that can serve as biomarkers for the exposures. Given that OPs and glyphosates disrupt hormone signaling, we also hypothesize that the biomarkers will be associated with known hormone-related breast cancer risk factors like breast density and age at menopause, which would increase our understanding of how DNA methylation relates to breast cancer development. General methodology: 400 women from the UCI Athena Breast Health Network, a cohort of >7,000 breast screening patients at UC Irvine who agreed to participate in research, will be recruited to participate in the study, which includes filling out study surveys and donating a blood sample and two urine samples. Study participants will be offered a personalized report containing their urinary levels of OP metabolites and glyphosate in comparison to national averages and averages among the study cohort, as well as access to the study physician if they have any questions about their report or their breast cancer risk. Methylation arrays will be used to determine methylation levels at >850,000 DNA sites, and the sites that are most correlated with urinary levels of OP metabolites and glyphosate will be identified as biomarkers for OP and glyphosate exposure. Innovative elements: This study has the potential to transform the field of breast cancer research related to environmental exposures because the DNA methylation markers will allow for more cost-effective, large scale analysis of samples collected in prospective studies as well as previously established cohorts in order to elucidate the relationship between the most commonly used pesticides in the U.S. and breast cancer risk, which may lead to changes in policy regarding use of these pesticides in order to protect human health. A better understanding of whether these pesticides affect breast cancer risk may help women make more informed decisions regarding pesticide exposures for herself and her loved ones. We will use the most up-to-date methylation array to analyze >850,000 DNA sites, the most sites out of all arrays currently available. Previous array analyses which analyzed fewer sites led to numerous discoveries of specific sites of DNA methylation being associated with various aspects of human health, including smoking status, and we anticipate that this new array will enable the discovery and validation of a statistically significant panel of methylation markers associated with pesticide exposure. Advocacy involvement and relevance to the human issues associated with breast cancer: Three experienced breast cancer research advocates comprise my Advocate Team for this study. They helped in the development of the specific aims, including the decision of which pesticides to study, and in development of the recruitment strategy. The protocol and all participant-facing materials will be vetted by the Advocate Team before implementation. The proposed study is extremely relevant to women who are eager to know about their breast cancer risk, especially those risk factors that can be avoided. There is suspicion among many women about the relationship between pesticides and breast cancer risk. The proposed study would help clarify this relationship.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Hannah Park,,,,"University of California, Irvine",https://ror.org/04gyf1771,ROR,https://ror.org/,2016-10-01,Issued,,22UB-2311,award-number,,,,,,

However, women may be exposed to several of these risk factors in their lives, and this combination of factors may ultimately increase their risk to a level far greater than that from either factor by itself. Of the many factors that may contribute to development of breast cancer, we plan to examine the combined effect of a suspect environmental chemical and an environmental social stressor. Clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that stress-related psychological factors in breast cancer patients, such as lack of social support, can associate with accelerated development of the disease and may do so by increasing the body's inflammation response. Likewise, certain environmental chemicals are hypothesized to act as tumor promoters through their effects on the body's inflammation response. Although animal models have been utilized to examine the effects of these factors individually on adverse health outcomes, rarely have both factors been examined at the same time and never at the same time in relation to breast cancer development. Among the several environmental chemicals that are hypothesized to induce systemic low-grade inflammation and promote tumor development are bisphenol A (BPA), which is used in plastic food packaging, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are flame retardant chemicals in textiles, foams, and plastics. Among the several laboratory stressors that researchers use to induce stress is social isolation, where the mouse is housed alone instead of in a group. Given that rodents are a social species that abide in groups, social isolation in female mice is seen as a form of stress that may be analogous to deprivation of social support in humans. Thus, we will examine the effect of each suspect environmental chemical, in combination with social isolation, on mammary gland inflammation and tumor development. Research question(s) or central hypotheses: Our first hypothesis is that mice exposed to a suspect environmental chemical and social stress have higher levels of mammary gland inflammation and greater development of tumor than mice exposed to just one of these factors or no factor. Our 2nd hypothesis asserts that mice exposed for longer time periods have higher levels of inflammation and greater development of tumor. This is based on the notion that longer duration equates to a higher ""dose"" of these pro-tumor factors. Our 3rd hypothesis acknowledges the possibility that ""young age"" may represent a window of increased vulnerability. We assert that mice exposed at an earlier age (pre-puberty) have higher levels of inflammation and greater development of tumor than mice exposed at older ages (post-puberty, post-pregnancy). General methodology: Standard mouse models of breast cancer promotion will be used. After laboratory mice are randomly assigned to one of the experiment's conditions, they will undergo exposure to an environmental chemical for 12 weeks (in group or isolated housing) before a relatively small number of breast cancer cells are injected into the mammary gland. Mice in each group will then be monitored for another 4 weeks so that effects of exposure and social isolation on tumor development can be determined. Mammary gland will then be collected from each mouse so that effects of exposure and isolation on inflammation can be analyzed. Innovative elements: This study may contribute to a major paradigm shift in our understanding of how environmental chemicals affect breast cancer risk: they increase low-grade inflammation in the body--an idea that is relatively new to cancer biology. In addition to measuring tumor size with standard handheld calipers, we will also be able to assess the metastatic potential of tumors by using imaging technology during tumor development to see if the growing tumor inside the living mouse has metastasized to other organs. This study also uses a genomics approach, which entails collecting tens of thousands of data points on gene expression from each mouse in the project, which will be shared on a public repository for other researchers to analyze. Advocacy involvement and relevance to the human issues associated with breast cancer: Dr. Sandra Finestone, Director of the Hope Wellness Center in Irvine, California, is serving as the advocate on this proposal. As both a breast cancer survivor and clinical psychologist, Dr. Finestone provides counseling and social support to hundreds of women with breast cancer. Given her professional knowledge of the kinds of human stress that may impact upon breast cancer development, Dr. Finestone will provide ongoing feedback on the methods by which we aim to generate analogous stress hormone responses in laboratory mice that can impact mammary cancer development. She will also disseminate our findings to the breast cancer community.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Donald Lamkin,,,,"University of California, Los Angeles",https://ror.org/046rm7j60,ROR,https://ror.org/,2017-04-01,Issued,,23UB-7320,award-number,,,,,,

Young breast cancer survivors often have many negative effects from their cancer treatments at a time when they are just beginning their adult lives. Compared to older breast cancer survivors, they have a greater chance of cancer recurrence, sexual dysfunction, depression, fatigue, low self-esteem, and negative thoughts about their body. Haus of Volta, and its founder Stori Nagel, noticed that physical activity was helpful for herself and many other young breast cancer survivors in readjusting to life after cancer treatments. Haus of Volta is interested in learning whether being physical active could help any of the common complaints among young survivors, and how to help fellow young breast cancer survivors be more active. Question(s) or hypotheses: We hypothesize that being physically active and being connected to other survivors could greatly improve many symptoms young survivors experience. We want to answer these questions: 1) is increasing physical activity helpful for young breast cancer survivors’ quality of life, and 2) how can young breast cancer survivors support each other to be more physically active? General methodology: First, we will train 4 young breast cancer survivors to be peer mentors for the physical activity intervention. Second, we will enroll 20 breast cancer survivors (under age of 50, greater than 6 months out of treatment, and currently not active) into a 12-week physical activity program. The program includes a Fitbit and associated apps to encourage and track physical activity, and peer support through an online message board and regular phone/video calls. Each participant will receive tailored support from a trained peer mentor. At the start of the intervention and twelve weeks later, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires measuring body image, self-esteem, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sexual health. A small device to measure physical activity will be mailed to participants to wear on their hip for 7 days at the start of the intervention and at twelve weeks. At the end of the study, participants and peer mentors will be interviewed to get their perspective on the intervention and ways to improve it and make it sustainable. Innovative elements: This study is innovative because it will test more convenient methods of helping young breast cancer survivors increase their activity by being completely remote and requiring no in-person contact. Using Fitbits and the Fitbit Coach app combined with peer support, we will test if we can help young cancer survivors add in activity to their busy, ever shifting schedules. An online message board through Fitbit will help them connect with other young cancer survivors in the study and support each other in reaching their goals. Community involvement: Haus of Volta is a nonprofit that has been working specifically with young breast cancer survivors since 2015. The founder, Ms. Nagel, has also been working as a State Leader for the Young Survival Coalition since 2014. The Haus of Volta’s close relationship with the young breast cancer survivor community led to this research question and plan. For this project, Haus of Volta will be involved in recruitment, as peer mentors to the women in the study, and interpreting the results. Haus of Volta will also use its connections with the larger young breast cancer survivor community to share the results of the study.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Sheri Hartman,,,,"University of California, San Diego",https://ror.org/0168r3w48,ROR,https://ror.org/,2018-08-01,Issued,,24AB-1300,award-number,,,,,,

Some household cleaning products, including floor, window and bathroom cleaners, furniture polish, air fresheners, and other cleaning agents, have been shown to contain chemicals that are known or suspected to cause cancer or disrupt hormones. Research shows that Latina women use more cleaning products than women of other races and ethnicities, suggesting that they may be at increased risk of exposure. However, little is known about the extent that women are exposed to these chemicals of concern during routine housecleaning or how they might reduce their exposure. Research Questions: We aim to characterize the household cleaning products used by Latina women, learn which chemicals are in these products, measure the chemicals in the air that women breathe during routine cleaning, and determine whether these concentrations in air decrease when they replace their products with “green” or “low chemical” cleaning products and are educated on ways to reduce exposure. Methods: This study will take place in the Salinas Valley, CA, an agricultural region with a large Latino farmworker population, where our community-researcher collaboration has a long-standing, community-based project. Our group facilitates a Salinas-based Youth Council (YC) of high school students interested in health environmental leadership. We will train the YC in research methods and work with them to design the study, develop questionnaires, conduct interviews and sample collection, analyze data, and disseminate results. The YC will recruit 80 Latina women living in or near Salinas and interview them about their household cleaning product use. At an initial home visit, each study participant will wear a small personal air monitoring device while she cleans her house using her usual products. Then, at a second home visit a few days later, the YC members will educate the participant on how she can reduce exposures to cleaning products, provide alternative “green cleaning” products, and collect a second air sample while she cleans her house with the new products. Air samples will be analyzed for the presence of 13 chemical classes of concern and we will determine whether chemical levels decreased when she changed cleaning products. We will also conduct laboratory analyzes to determine the chemical contents of several cleaning products of concern. Innovation. This study will be conducted primarily by youth. By employing teens to conduct the research, we will be empowering them, giving them marketable skills, creating job opportunities and raising their interest in science, community issues, breast cancer, and the environment. In addition, by engaging teens in the dissemination, education, and advocacy portion of the study, we are increasing our outreach. We hope that simple messages demonstrating chemical exposures in the air that women breathe while cleaning and showing how to reduce these exposures will have a powerful impact. In our work in the Salinas Valley, we have learned that children, often more acculturated and fluently bilingual, are a conduit for educating parents. Thus, through youth, we hope to raise community awareness about breast cancer and chemicals in the environment. Community Involvement. The proposed study is rooted in the 20 year-old CHAMACOS community- university partnership between the Center for Environmental Research and Children’s Health (CERCH) and Clinica de Salud del Valle Salinas (CSVS). CHAMACOS partners have engaged in extensive environmental health education activities, reaching over 30,000 residents. The CHAMACOS project is guided by a Community Advisory Board with input from the YC, Grower Council, and Farmworker Council. For this project, the CHAMACOS partnership will work with the YC in conducting all phases of the study. The YC, in partnership with CERCH and CSVS, and in consultation with other breast cancer and environmental advocacy groups, will develop education materials and strategies to reduce household cleaning product exposures in the Latino community based on results of the study. Future Plans. We aim to disseminate the results of this study to local and statewide medical, health, and social service agencies involved in the health of Latino communities. The YC has engaged youth in environmental health research since 2010 and we hope to continue this tradition. As the youth graduate from high school, their participation in the YC helps prepare them for college and their careers.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Kim Harley,,,,"University of California, Berkeley",https://ror.org/01an7q238,ROR,https://ror.org/,2018-08-01,Issued,,24BB-2300,award-number,,,,,,

Nicotine in THS can be converted to cancer-causing agents during aging. While little is known about how THS affects human health, data have shown that it produces changes in cells that could lead to cancer and other adverse health effects. This research on THS and human health identifies and investigates effects of the most toxic constituents of THS on cell stress and death in animal and human cells. The goal is to generate scientific information to inform the public and officials to create rational policies for the regulation of indoor smoking and remediation of areas contaminated by THS. Data from our previous experiments show that THS is characterized by: (1) volatile organic chemicals that disperse over time and (2) residual chemicals that persist for many months. Both types of chemicals were cytotoxic, killing cells at higher doses and inducing stress at non-lethal doses. The goal of the proposed research is to study cell toxicity of chemicals extracted from fabric samples exposed to smoke in the laboratory and in fabrics from filed sites including homes and casinos; measure the amounts of chemicals deposited during various lengths of time; identity the volatile chemicals that induce cytotoxicity; and study molecular indicators that THS-exposed cells are stressed and/or dying. This research will compare results from cultured human cells growing in vitro, literally “in glass,” and cell and blood samples from THS-exposed mice and humans. The first Specific Aim will measure THS toxicity in human cells and then identify the specific molecules that are targeted by THS. Fabric samples exposed to THS in a laboratory environmental chamber and collected from homes and casinos will be carpet, upholstery and drapes, which are likely to act as long-term repositories of THS chemicals. This Aim will use new assays to measure cellular processes affected by THS. One assay will examine videos of living cells to observe cell stress, and use software to detect subtle changes not apparent to human observers. The second Specific Aim will identify the volatile chemicals in THS-exposed fabrics that cause cytotoxicity and stress and identify which cell functions are targets of the most potent chemicals. The third Specific Aim will measure biological markers in cells that display an adverse reaction to THS in human fluid/cell samples and animal tissues, and compare these results with cell data from Aims #1 and 2. Biomarkers of harm include changes in the expression of genes that result from cell stress and reactions to toxicity. The project will: (1) provide new quantitative data on cell stress and death caused by THS chemicals extracted from fabrics exposed in the laboratory and in casinos and homes; (2) determine which types of fabrics retain the highest concentrations of THS chemicals and are most harmful to cells, (3) compare THS sensitivity in cells from embryos and adults, (4) identify the cellular processes and molecular targets affected by THS; (5) identify specific volatile chemicals in THS that cause cell death/stress, (6) compare how the concentrations of nicotine and other THS chemicals in cultured cells compare to actual concentrations in humans and mice exposed to THS, and (7) determine if biomarkers of harm are elevated similarly in cultured cells, mice and humans exposed to THS. This is the first study to compare the toxicity of THS across cell, animal, and human models. Data will immediately inform regulatory agencies of the types of potential harm from various fabrics, exposure times, dosages, cell types, cell targets, and stages of development. The experiments also will accelerate future studies of THS by validating cell, mouse, and human cell study models and documenting measurements of THS harmful effects in these different cells.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Prue Talbot,,,,"University of California, Riverside",https://ror.org/03nawhv43,ROR,https://ror.org/,2015-07-01,Issued,,24RT-0037H,award-number,,,,,,

Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) processes, the long-term goal of this pilot project is to decrease breast cancer mortality through enhanced lay patient navigation that addresses the unique psychosocial needs of VA women with breast cancer. The research team brings together expertise in CBPR, breast cancer navigation programs, mental health and social support, all among VA women. Question(s) or hypotheses: The primary research questions for this pilot study are: what are the psychosocial needs of VA women with breast cancer? General methodology: We will conduct both quantitative surveys with a convenience sample of 60 VA women with breast cancer to understand the prevalence of specific psychosocial needs, and follow-up qualitative, in-depth interviews with a subset of 15 women to further explore how culture, stigma, and possible intervention efforts may influence their needs. CBPR methods will strengthen our community-university collaborative, inform the tailoring of study surveys and interview guides, and generate intervention ideas for future research development and testing. Innovative elements: This pilot CANVAS study is innovative in several ways. First, it is based upon real-world observations and questions by VACF staff about what they can do to understand and address the unique psychosocial needs of their clients. Second, existing research on Asian breast cancer focuses on navigation to breast cancer screening or support for long-term survivorship, and existing breast cancer navigation research focuses on clinic-based models of coordination. Thus, this study fills an important gap in the research literature by focusing on the psychosocial needs of VA women that may be amenable to community-based lay patient navigation services. Community involvement: The idea for this study was generated by staff at VACF and further informed by meetings with three VA doctors with significant experience treating breast cancer. They provided important input on the barriers to care among breast cancer patients. Lastly, we met with members of our Community Advisory Board (CAB) (which includes five Vietnamese breast cancer survivors) to review the research questions, methodology and timeline. The Vietnamese community in Orange County will be involved in this pilot project in several ways. Our CAB will actively participate in all aspects of the project implementation, including refinement of the interview guide and survey, training of VACF navigators as project interviewers, participant recruitment, data collection and analyses, intervention ideas development, and community and scientific dissemination. VACF staff will serve as study leaders, interviewers, and data analyzers. The study team also includes a well-known Vietnamese American psychologist who has worked on community mental health, family, community and social issues since 2002.

This region is also characterized by breast cancer incidence rates significantly higher than the State average. Findings from two Community Health Impacts of Mining Exposure (CHIME) pilot studies found elevated As body burdens in local women compared to what might be expected from national data, higher levels of Cd in long-term residents, and higher body burden and residential soil levels of some metals in women with a history of breast cancer. Data from both studies suggested that body burden levels of As were higher in women who reported routine consumption of produce from home gardens and were active in running and walking on local trails. In a third pilot study we are currently working alongside the community to conduct an extensive and comprehensive exposure assessment to identify potential routes of exposure by identifying environmental hazards in a sample of participants’ home, garden, school and recreational areas. The goal of the proposed study is to further pursue the implications of these pilot studies’ findings by taking an expanded look at the pattern of breast cancer incidence throughout the Gold Country region and to collect information on personal and household risk factors that might help explain pilot study findings to date. Question(s) or hypotheses: The primary hypotheses of this proposal are 1) Breast cancer incidence is higher in closer proximately to mines sites; 2) Cd and As body burden is associated with environmental exposures through gardening and trail use in areas with mining residue. General methodology: The proposed study is an effort to continue active community engagement in an investigation into the health consequences of living in a mining-impacted community. An established and expanded Community Advisory Board (CAB) will guide and oversee all phases of the study. The aims of this study are to assess patterns of breast cancer incidence in Gold Country using geographic information about mines and other land features, as well as socioeconomic factors. We will also conduct an exposure assessment by recruiting and training citizen scientists to estimate residents’ daily exposure to cadmium and arsenic. This project will continue the environmental risk communication and dialogue in the community, disseminate and explain study results, and ultimately generate community guided strategies for exposure reduction. Innovative elements: The study will retain three innovative elements of the CHIME pilot studies: 1) CHIME was the first ever CBCRP-funded CRC project to be awarded to a community partner as prime with the academic partner as the sub-contractor, reflecting the project’s genesis within the community; 2) CHIME also broke new ground as the first ever project approved by the scientific partner’s IRB to return individual results to participants, identified by the CAB as critical to the community’s right to know; and 3) CHIME featured citizen science, with a continued view to active participant engagement to conduct further data collection to increase participation in historically underrepresented groups . In addition, new work with our University of Arizona partner, is developing innovative methods of assessing sources of exposure to the metals of interest to inform potential for remediation and risk reduction. Community involvement: This is a project conceived by the community, prompted by concern among local residents about the health effects of their mining legacy in light of efforts to reopen mining operations. In addition, environmental assessments by SSI have revealed widespread heavy metal contamination. The primary aim of CHIME is to establish a community dialogue and involve the community in all aspects of the study. A key element of community engagement is to train participants as citizen scientists to collect environmental data, an approach that is central to SSI’s stewardship model. With 19 years of citizen-generated validated environmental data, SSI will lead the environmental data collection effort by using rigorous protocols and training participants in their use. Future Plans: Future research is expected to include epidemiological research on other outcomes related to Cd and As such as child development, birth outcomes, and other cancers. Future studies would also benefit the community by disseminating strategies that minimize exposures and prevent the target metals from entering homes, thereby reducing body burden. The findings of the pilot and of future studies will also be used to support requests for funding of efforts that engage the local community in cleaning up mining’s toxic legacy throughout Gold Country.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Taylor Schobel,,,,Sierra Streams Institute,https://ror.org/029pa0p32,ROR,https://ror.org/,2019-08-01,Issued,,25BB-1101,award-number,,,,,,

MRI is the most sensitive imaging technique for breast cancer detection. However, there are several challenges and concerns involved with MRI screening for breast cancer. MRI screening involves the injection of a contrast agent, and there is a concern that long-term exposure to the contrast agent can have unforeseen side effects. This is especially a concern for high risk women who begin screening at an early age, and then annually thereafter. Contrast also has limited ability to convey diagnostic information about certain types of lesions. These lesions, called non-mass enhancing lesions, make up a significant proportion of cancers diagnosed in women. Additionally, MRI screening with contrast can be so sensitive that it may lead to many biopsies with benign outcomes. This leads to a high number of unnecessary biopsies and stress for the patient. Due to these concerns, researchers are developing new MRI screening techniques, some of which are based on identifying a concerning lesion more accurately without the need to inject contrast, specifically by evaluating the motion of water within cancer cells. This non-contrast approach is called diffusion imaging. To date, these methods have had their own challenges and are used in conjunction with, but not instead of, contrast enhanced MRI screening. We have developed a non-contrast MRI diffusion technique, called Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI), that potentially improves upon prior non-contrast techniques and may serve as a comprehensive method to accurately identify concerning lesions without the need for intravenous contrast. We propose that Restriction Spectrum Imaging may improve upon prior non-contrast diffusion techniques due to its ability to more specifically detect cancer cells as demonstrated in prior brain and prostate applications. In preliminary studies, we have also demonstrated this technique is equivalent to contrast enhanced MRI in evaluating response to chemotherapy in breast cancers. We hypothesize that this technique may be superior to standard diffusion non-contrast imaging on MRI, and adapted as a screening protocol for women at high risk for breast cancer. The question(s) or central hypotheses of the research: Goal: Determine an optimal non-contrast MRI protocol for detecting breast cancer for women at high risk for the disease. Hypothesis: Restriction Spectrum Imaging (non-contrast technique) will detect breast cancers as well as standard contrast enhanced MRI. The general methodology: Initial development will be performed in a cohort of 60 women, where half the patients will have benign findings and half the patients will have malignant lesions. This cohort will be used for methodology and protocol development in tuning the RSI-MRI technique for breast cancer detection. After the initial protocol is developed on patients with biopsy proven benign or malignant lesions, the protocol will be applied to a cohort of 125 women at high risk for breast cancer. This will allow for initial evaluation of RSI in a high-risk screening population.

Perhaps this is because today’s standard immune-cell imaging (the nuclear medicine Indium-111 WBC scan) subjects the patient to far too much radiation for a screening exam. A new imaging method, Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI), has extraordinary potential to reveal the patient’s own immune cell homing to early-stage lung cancer, and it has zero radiation dose. My engineering group at UC Berkeley has designed and built all the MPI scanners in the USA. In “immunotheranostic MPI”, we will first pre-label immune cells with safe MPI magnetic tracers, then inject them into the body intravenously. We will then wait hours (or days) for the immune cells to home to areas of early lung cancer and then image the entire body in an MPI scanner. MPI can “see” pre-labeled cells with exquisite sensitivity. We recently demonstrated 200-cell sensitivity in the world’s first MPI cell tracking in the lungs, which is 100-fold greater sensitivity than any of our whole-animal cell tracking methods. We hypothesize that early tobacco-related lung tumors will be revealed by immunotheranostic MPI with high sensitivity and specificity because immune surveillance will be intact during the earliest stages of cancer. As one piece of evidence, Tumor Associated Neutrophils (TANs) constitute up to 25% of cells from isolated early stage lung tumors. The ACS notes that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, causing about 1 out of 4 cancer deaths, or about 158,000 deaths annually. The CDC notes “Cigarette smoking is the number one risk factor for lung cancer. In the United States, cigarette smoking is linked to about 80% to 90% of lung cancers.” Early-stage diagnosis is crucial to reduce lung cancer mortality, but, sadly, this remains very uncommon. The ALA states: “The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is 54 percent for cases detected when the disease is still localized. However, only 15 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage. For distant tumors the five-year survival rate is only 4 percent.” Hence, improving imaging methods for early lung cancer diagnosis is our goal. Since today’s noninvasive imaging methods (MRI and ultrasound) are ineffective in lungs, Low-Dose CT (LDCT) is used to screen high-risk patients for lung cancer. The ACS notes that in the National Lung Screening Trial “people who got LDCT had a 16% lower chance of dying from lung cancer than those who got chest X-rays.” However, LDCT shows very poor specificity, with 98% of biopsies finding no malignancies. Clearly, we need a better and a less invasive imaging method for early-stage lung cancer screening. Here we aim to demonstrate, for the first time, that MPI targeted to the patient’s own immune cells will provide early diagnosis of tobacco-related lung cancer. Immune cells are thought to home to early cancers, when the immune surveillance system is still intact. MPI is a completely noninvasive biomedical imaging modality, relying on different physics and hardware from MRI, Ultrasound, X-ray and CT. MPI is a tracer imaging method, like nuclear medicine. My engineering group at UC Berkeley has designed and built all the MPI scanners in the USA. This year, we published the first demonstration of MPI cell tracking in lungs, showing 200-cell (200-nM tracer) sensitivity in vivo and also 87-day cell tracking. No other imaging modality can match this performance in the lungs. Moreover, MPI will be translatable to human studies since MPI uses zero radiation; safe magnetic fields; and safe iron oxide nanoparticle tracers.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Steven Conolly,,,,"University of California, Berkeley",https://ror.org/01an7q238,ROR,https://ror.org/,2017-08-01,Issued,,26IP-0049S,award-number,,,,,,

In this application, we propose a unique and innovative study aiming to gain preliminary data on impact of SHS on epigenetic changes, which has enormous public health relevance.

This creates a sustained disease state throughout the body called vascular inflammation and causes cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and impacts over 61 million Americas each year. A properly functioning blood vessel cell has many tightly regulated proteins sending signals to turn on or off other proteins controlling different functions of the cell. Smoking has been shown to disrupt this cell signaling. This proposal examines one such pathway. However, to understand how this is affected by smoking, first, the mechanisms by which this cell signals in healthy conditions must be examined. The goal of this proposal is to understand how activation of a receptor in the blood vessels, specifically the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), leads to vascular inflammation. We have previously shown the protein, p38 MAPK is activated by PAR1 and it is well established p38 MAPK is an important mediator of inflammation. Yet, how PAR1 signals via p38 MAPK to promote vascular pro-inflammatory responses remains poorly understood. The specific objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which p38 MAPK signaling induced by activated PAR1 promotes vascular inflammation. The proposed studies will determine if PAR1 activation of p38 functions through two proteins, MAPKAPK2 (MK2) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) to promote inflammatory responses. Both MK2 and HSP27 are shown to be turned on by p38 MAPK and have been shown to influence vascular inflammation. In preliminary studies, I found that both MK2 and HSP27 are turned on through a p38-dependent pathway following stimulation of PAR1 in endothelial (blood vessel specific) cells. The focus of the proposed studies will be to determine how PAR1 stimulated of MK2 and HSP27 regulate vascular inflammation by using both cell and animal models to assess this question. The contribution of this work is expected to be significant and will provide new information regarding a novel signaling pathway in blood vessels that modulates vascular inflammation and new strategies for targeted-drug development to control vascular inflammation.

COPD is made up of a number of clinical features including airway inflammation (chronic bronchitis) in addition to destruction of lung tissue (emphysema). The processes involved in leading to these clinical manifestations are poorly understood. We know that inflammation associated with cigarette smoke (CS) is a contributing factor, however little is known about what drives the chronic inflammation observed in COPD. Current treatments fail to inhibit this chronic inflammation activated by CS exposure. Thus, there is a desperate need for new avenues of investigation aimed at identifying novel regulators of smoke-induced inflammation. We are interested in studying RNA genes and determining their role in controlling inflammation. From RNA-sequencing studies we now know that less than 3% of the human genome codes for protein, yet over 85% is actively transcribed. Why so much RNA is produced and whether it is all biologically relevant remains a fundamental unsolved problem. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins, represent the largest group of genes transcribed from the genome. LncRNAs have emerged as key regulators of biological processes and we have discovered the first case of a lncRNA that functions to regulate inflammation in critical immune cells called macrophages. Specifically, we identified lincRNA-Cox2, as one of the top genes turned on following inflammation, which functions to regulate critical genes within inflammatory pathways. The aim of our research is to better understand the basic mechanisms involved in controlling inflammation within chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This project is a pilot study to test our hypothesis that lncRNAs function within the immune system to control inflammation. We are taking two approaches to test our hypothesis; one is a high throughput approach to study all lncRNAs and identify those involved in controlling inflammation and the second is a focused approach to study lincRNA-Cox2 in animal models to determine if it is involved in COPD disease progression.

Stale tobacco odor is a recognized problem for residents moving into homes formerly occupied by smokers, as well as for landlords and realtors. Tobacco residue, also called thirdhand smoke, contains toxic chemicals and carcinogens. This is expected as tobacco smoke is known to contain many toxic compounds. A concern for many affected people is “How can this tobacco residue be removed or reduced? How risky is this residue?” This research will directly address these questions. We will investigate whether a commercial cleaning can reduce toxic chemicals related to tobacco smoke residue in house dust samples from low income homes. We will measure these samples before and after cleaning. We choose to focus on house dust samples as children are known to be at risk from toxicants in contaminated house dust, and well established methods exist for determining exposure and risks to children. Due to their hand-to-mouth behaviors and short stature, children ingest much more house dust than adults. In addition, resuspension of dust near the floor results in breathing in dust, and an increase in skin contact coupled with a thinner skin relative to adults can lead to significant skin exposures. Therefore, tobacco residue exposures through house dust can pose a risk to children. In terms of cleaning up tobacco residue, little is available to guide cleaning methods and remediation efforts, and no standards exist to help decide if clean-up has been achieved. Indeed, some of the methods described on the internet, such as using ozone generators to remove odors, likely result in secondary formation of toxic products. This study will provide information on the levels of toxic components of thirdhand smoke and the effectiveness of commercially available deep cleaning procedures on reducing thirdhand smoke residue in real home settings. We have already collected these samples from low income homes in San Diego County. We will measure a wide range of toxic chemicals in the dust and calculate risks to children from contaminated house dust both before and after the cleaning was performed. We hypothesize that levels of these pollutants in dust and on surfaces were reduced through the cleaning protocols and that risks to children will be measurably reduced.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Penelope Quintana,,,,San Diego State University Research Foundation,,,,2018-04-01,Issued,,27IP-0028C,award-number,,,,,,

Vaping has been traditionally thought of as a method of using nicotine (or simply flavors), but increasingly, many youth are using these devices to vape cannabis (marijuana). Recent reports suggest that 8-29% of youth have vaped cannabis. Nevertheless, the public health community is divided regarding whether vaping poses a threat to the public health of youth. Some argue that youth who vape are those who otherwise would have used other forms of nicotine or cannabis (for example, smoking cigarettes or combustible marijuana). Others are concerned that because youth can vape solutions in different flavors and using popular high-tech devices, low risk youth who would not otherwise have smoked may try vaping, and may then progress on to other types of substance use (the catalyst model of the impact of vaping). Because there still remains relatively limited research regarding vaping among adolescents and young adults – particularly of cannabis – it is unclear whether urgent, targeted efforts are warranted to prevent youth vaping, or what types of messages would be most effective. In the current proposal, we aim to rigorously test the catalyst model to determine whether vaping is recruiting low-risk youth via appealing characteristics, and whether those who vape are more likely to progress to other types of substance use. We will leverage an existing sample with data on vaping both nicotine and cannabis, and will follow this cohort yearly as they age into early adulthood (ages 18-21). Using digital surveys, we will collect detailed information of vaping or combustible nicotine and cannabis use frequency (days used in past 30) and intensity (vaping episodes per day, puffs per episode, number of joints/cigarettes smoked per day). We will also add images and video clips depicting different vaping products to the online survey to identify which particular product features are predictive of vaping (particularly among low-risk youth) and should be targeted in regulatory policy. Our first aim of the project is to test hypotheses derived from Step 1 of the catalyst model – to determine whether and how lower risk populations are being drawn into vaping nicotine and cannabis. We hypothesize that low-risk adolescents and young adults will be more likely to vape than to use combustible products. Our second aim is to test hypotheses derived from Step 2 of the catalyst model – to determine whether and how AYAs who vape are more vulnerable to other forms of drug use. Specifically, we hypothesize that vaping nicotine or cannabis may increase the likelihood of: (i) poly-substance vaping, (ii) combustible cannabis and tobacco product use, including poly-substance use, (iii) use of other drugs, (iv) nicotine, cannabis, or other drug dependence. We will further test our hypothesis that these transitions occur because youth who vape experience rewarding effects from vaping, and in turn have greater expectancies that other forms of drug use will similarly engender rewarding effects, thus increasing the likelihood of experimentation with other substances. Addressing these aims collectively will inform whether and how vaping attracts a broad segment of low-risk youth and young adults into nicotine and/or cannabis use, leads to regular use, and adversely impacts the drug use burden in an era when vaping is rampant entry point into nicotine and cannabis use.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Jessica Barrington-Trimis,,,,University of Southern California,https://ror.org/03taz7m60,ROR,https://ror.org/,2018-04-01,Issued,,27IR-0034,award-number,,,,,,

Since its first introduction in US commerce in the mid 2000s, sales in the e-cigarette industry increased to $3.5 billion in 2015.

New e-cigarettes, such as third generation devices or open-tank systems, have increased the functionality for consumers by allowing any e-liquid to be added to the device and offering variable power settings, which can increase the temperature of the device, as well as the output of aerosol and delivery of nicotine. While third generation e-cigarette devices have gained popularity over prior device generations, it is not well understood how varying device settings and e-liquid formulations may influence chemical exposure and respiratory health effects in comparison to smoking conventional tobacco cigarettes.

This high rate of smoking continues even though people with HIV are more susceptible to the negative effects of tobacco, including greater risk for conditions such as cancer, as well as cardiovascular and lung diseases. Importantly, smokers living with HIV (SLWH) say that they are less motivated to quit because smoking helps them control their emotions and many people in their social networks are smokers, which could lead to negative social consequences if they did quit. In contrast, having clear information about the specific effects of smoking in the context of HIV disease was noted to be a powerful motivator to quit. Given this background, investigating the social-emotional abilities that support social interaction, which is known as “social cognition,” in SLWH may identify problems that would be key areas to target in treatments for quitting smoking to enhance their success. In support of that idea, one type of social cognition problem, poor ability to identify and describe one’s feelings, has been linked to increased tobacco craving. Problems with other kinds of social cognition, including accurately reading the emotions and intentions of other people, have yet to be studied in relation to tobacco craving but have been linked to worse severity of addiction to alcohol and stimulants, suggesting they may be relevant in tobacco use as well. Also, both HIV and smoking can affect inflammation, which then contributes to multiple poor health outcomes. Social-emotional distress is related to higher inflammation; however, the exact nature of this relationship remains unknown in SLWH. Therefore, this pilot proposal will examine social cognition in a group of people with and without HIV, half of whom will be current smokers. Social cognition will be assessed, and it is hypothesized that SLWH will have worse performance. This poor performance will be related to increased tobacco craving in the smokers, and this relationship will be stronger in SLWH.

While metastasis is the leading-cause of breast cancer-related deaths, there are still no effective ways of preventing this disease. This is all the more frustrating since many metastases form months or even several years after initial surgery or chemotherapy as recurrent disease. While breast cancer subtypes are useful predictors of the response to therapy they do not adequately identify a tumor’s metastatic potential. My work on normal mammary stem cells important for remodeling the breast during pregnancy led to my recent discovery of a new cancer stem cell (CSC) population associated with aggressive disease in multiple clinical subtypes. This suggests that these cells are important biomarkers of breast cancers likely to progress and potential targets for drug therapy. Importantly, I have identified a key cell survival pathway that, when reversed, may represent a critical vulnerability of these CSCs. Thus, my proposal will test the hypothesis that blocking this pathway represents an Achilles heel for CSCs that will prevent recurrence and metastasis regardless of breast cancer subtype. If successful, my studies would represent an important breakthrough toward the goal of reducing deaths from breast cancer. My approach will incorporate not only more expedient cell lines, but also state-of-the-art patient-derived tumor models in which to test my therapies in cancers that better reflect patient disease, including estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and triple-negative subtypes. By investigating my therapy in recurrence models post-chemotherapy, I will go the extra mile in attempting to prevent metastasis in a setting that mirrors what patients often experience. Importantly, I plan to re-purpose pre-existing drugs, already approved for use in patients, thereby accelerating the potential for translating successful outcomes from these studies into the clinic. By focusing on eliminating CSCs, my proposed studies represent a sea change in how breast cancer therapies are identified and tested in the laboratory.

A community-university partnership between Black Ladies Advocating for Cancer Care (BLACC) Peer Navigators and the Stanford Office of Community Engagement has come together to address this disparity by focusing on peer navigation for African American women. Peer navigation has been identified as a promising strategy to address breast cancer disparities and improve outcomes by addressing barriers to quality cancer care and providing comprehensive social support. Several critical gaps in research limit the implementation of peer navigation to address disparities faced by African American women. First, peer navigation programs that have been tested vary widely in terms of who serves as peer navigators, how they are trained, and what services are provided. Second, there have been very few peer navigation programs that were developed by and for African American women.

Chemotherapy is used for the treatment of patients with metastatic TNBC. However, patients often develop resistance to chemotherapies and recurrence of cancer is common after initial response. Hence, there is an urgent need for improved therapies. We believe that an optimal therapeutic should not only eradicate tumors but also prevent tumor recurrence. Immunotherapy has shown unprecedented long-lasting efficacy in several types of malignancies. Therefore, we propose to study a novel therapeutic approach called “viro-immunotherapy”, which is a combination of two novel therapeutic approaches: Oncolytic virotherapy and Immunotherapy. Oncolytic viruses are live viruses “tamed” to replicate in and kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed. We have generated an artificial oncolytic poxvirus (CF33) that is very potent in killing breast cancer cells. This virus can further be armed with immune-stimulatory genes to act as immunotherapy for better treatment ofTNBC. Central hypotheses: We hypothesize that a chimeric poxvirus (CF33) can be engineered to selectively replicate in and kill triple negative breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the virus can be modified to produce two immune-stimulatory proteins, LIGHT and IL-15, which can further increase anti-tumor effectiveness of the virus by provoking anti-tumor immune response. Finally, virally produced immune-stimulatory proteins will prevent the cancer from recurrence by long-term maintenance of cancer-specific memory immune cells. The general methodology: We have already created a potent oncolytic poxvirus (CF33) that can kill triple negative breast cancer cells. We have also armed this virus with the immune-stimulatory genes LIGHT and IL-15 (CF33-LIGHT-IL-15). We will explore safety and anti-tumor efficacy of CF33-LIGHT-IL-15 in mouse models. Innovative elements and potential impacts: The main innovation of this project is the development of a next-generation immuno-oncolytic virus that combines the direct cancer killing ability of a chimeric poxvirus with enhancement of anti-tumor immunity through immune-stimulatory proteins produced by the virus. Our innovative project has the potential of developing a novel therapeutic for improved treatment, with less resistance and recurrence, ofTNBC.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Shyambabu Chaurasiya,,,,Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope,https://ror.org/05fazth07,ROR,https://ror.org/,2020-08-01,Issued,,B26IB1393,award-number,,,,,,

Immunotherapy directs our own immune system to attack cancer cells, versus traditional cancer drugs that target the cancer cells directly. However, to date, responses to immunotherapy in patients with breast cancer have been limited compared to other cancers such as melanoma. One reason for this lack of success is that the immune cells that are trying to attack the cancer cells are being inhibited. This inhibition is due in part to depletion of nutrients that feed the immune cells and allow them to function. Two of these nutrients are the amino acids cysteine and arginine. The goal of this project is to show that reversing the depletion of these nutrients by disrupting their metabolism will increase the success of immunotherapy in breast cancer. We will treat mice that have breast cancer with immunotherapy that has been previously shown to have limited benefit in this model. Some mice will receive immunotherapy along with the drug Viagra, which blocks arginine metabolism. Other mice will receive immunotherapy along with agents that block cysteine metabolism. The effectiveness of treatments will be measured based on whether the mice that get nutrient metabolism-targeted agents show increased tumor shrinkage compared to mice that receive immunotherapy alone. Additionally, we will study the immune cells in these tumors to understand how they change in response to therapy. Our proposal is innovative and significant because it provides a novel strategy to treat breast cancer by combining immunotherapy with agents that reverse nutrient depletion in and around the tumor. Viagra is currently in clinical trials to help treat other types of cancers, which will speed up the translation of our findings with this agent to use in the clinic for patients with breast cancer. A demonstration that our strategies targeting cysteine metabolism can enhance immunotherapy will provide critical data to support further studies to refine these agents into actual therapeutics. The impact of these studies will be novel combination immunotherapies that fulfill the potential of this powerful new class of therapy so patients with breast cancer can enjoy the benefits of immunotherapy that patients with other types of cancer have started to benefit from.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Michael Campbell,,,,"University of California, San Francisco",https://ror.org/043mz5j54,ROR,https://ror.org/,2020-08-01,Issued,,B26IB1404,award-number,,,,,,

BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for at least half of inherited breast cancer. Mutations on BRCA1 predispose women to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive breast cancer subtype with a 12% 5-year survival rate when TNBC spreads to other parts of the body. Prophylactic mastectomy while effective to reduce breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 patients, poses significant psychological side effects and impairs the life quality of BRCA1 carriers. A noninvasive method is urgently needed for breast cancer early detection and/or prevention in BRCA1 carriers. An essential step is to understand how the normal breast epithelial cells become pre-neoplastic lesions and later tumor cells in BRCA1 patients. Human breast epithelium is organized as a bilayer with a basal layer of myoepithelial cells and luminal epithelial layer surrounding the mammary lumen. Early work demonstrated that the long-lived luminal epithelial cells or luminal progenitors are the cellular origin of BRCA1-associated breast cancer. However, only a small subset of luminal progenitors responds to BRCA1 loss and become aberrantly differentiated. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the cellular origin of BRCA1 breast cancer and to dissect the mechanism(s) to control the transition from normal breast epithelial cells to pre-neoplastic lesions and tumor cells. Our preliminary data thus far identified a novel marker in the BRCA1-deficient luminal progenitors. We hypothesize that this unique luminal progenitor cells are the cellular origin of BRCA1 breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, we will use a mouse model to specifically deplete BRCA1 in aberrant luminal progenitors while simultaneously labeling the cells with red fluorescent protein to follow the BRCA1 deficient cells. Using the single cell gene expression profile technology, we will track the development of the red normal cells to red pre-neoplastic lesions and red tumor cells. This analysis will provide key insights into the mechanism(s) of pre-neoplastic lesion formation, one of earliest stage of breast cancer.

Chemical contaminants detected throughout the neighborhood and deemed carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls, some of which have been detected in groundwater. Exposure to endocrine disrupting pollutants has been found to increase the risk of breast cancer. As EDCs are persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is important to assess the longer-term impacts of EDC exposures across generations. In San Francisco, Black/African American women experience the greatest disparities in breast cancer-related outcomes. Compared to other neighborhoods in San Francisco, women from BVHP were more likely to be diagnosed with more aggressive breast tumors with a faster growth rate, and overall higher breast cancer mortality rates. BVHP residents have the shortest life expectancy in the San Francisco area, well below California's average life expectancy of 82 years. A decades-long history of systemic racism and multiple environmental contaminants, combined with ineffective assessments, poor clean-up, and untrustworthy behavior by institutions, has contributed to BVHP community concerns about the potential link between exposure to toxic contaminants and cancers and frustration over a lack of reliable scientific information about risk, accountability and transparency of government and industry polluters to clean up known toxins, and the need for greater community engagement and oversight. The goals of this pilot project are to address the organizational and research issues necessary for creating an intervention strategy that would provide women living in the BVHP with the training and support – the Health Equity Advocates and Leaders in Environmental Research and Science (HEALERS) program - to educate and activate the community about the prevention of harmful environmental exposures and advocate for policies that protect health and decrease incidence of breast cancer.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Kim Rhoads,,,,"University of California, San Francisco",https://ror.org/043mz5j54,ROR,https://ror.org/,2022-08-01,Issued,,B28PP5729,award-number,,,,,,

Through peer-to-peer learning, Latinas will learn about actions that individuals, families, and communities can take to lower their exposure to toxins. The main focus will be on the behaviors that can be changed as a result of this training as the Latinas within this study population cannot control all environmental exposures they may be in contact with in their workplace or at home. Latinas will have a chance to use a text-based app program that will provide additional educational materials and resources, apart from what they learned from the Promotoras. We hope to include 20 promotoras who each deliver a training to two groups of 8-10 Latinas within their communities. Therefore, we believe a total of 180-200 participants will be included in the study. We will discover the impact of the promotora training program in three main areas: if the Latinas trained in the program learn new information about hidden hazards and how to reduce and eliminate their exposures, if Latinas feel confident in adjusting their behaviors to lessen their contact with dangerous chemicals, and if indeed they change any behaviors or actions to lower their contact with environmental toxins. We will give the Latinas a survey before and after they are educated by the Promotoras to collect information about what they knew before learning from the Promotoras, as well as what they found out about because of the program. We will also ask survey questions about their backgrounds, so that we know information about who the Latinas are that received the educational training from Promotoras.

These approaches look for novel exposures in nurses very broadly without deciding in advance which chemicals to target. The project responds to nurse collaborators’ concerns about hazardous work exposures. We propose to measure nurses’ exposure to disinfectants, drugs, PFAS, and other breast cancer-relevant chemicals; to integrate biomonitoring and workplace air monitoring through a silicone wristband; and to discover associations between exposures and early biological effects that we measure in their blood. We have four specific aims: Aim 1: Collect blood, urine, and silicone wristband passive air monitors from 60 nurses and 40 office workers. Measure chemicals of interest using targeted and non-targeted approaches. Aims 2 and 3: Compare exposures between nurses and office workers and identify correlated exposures between wristbands and blood. Aim 4: Identify changes in blood that are associated with chemical exposures and determine affected biological pathways relevant to breast cancer. We hypothesize that we will detect drugs, disinfectants, PFAS and other breast cancer-relevant exposures in wristbands or blood, that nurses will have some unique exposures, and that some chemical exposures will be associated with biological changes in blood. This project advances a critical path to breast cancer prevention by applying new methods for measuring exposures to breast cancer-relevant chemicals and associated early biological changes. Measuring these associations provides insights into biological pathways for breast cancer-relevant chemicals and supports efforts to reduce exposures. By studying nurses, we may uncover potential sources of higher breast cancer risk in this group. Our partnership of researchers, advocates, and nurses ensures our questions are relevant to what exposed communities care about and produces the science needed to strengthen public health protections.

Many environmental chemicals could transmit breast cancer risk from mother to daughter during the mother’s pregnancy. Stress may magnify the consequences of exposures in the womb. Research Questions. 1) Are there patterns in our DNA in midlife (DNA methylation, DNAm, which impact how genes are regulated) that signify exposure to environmental chemicals in the womb? 2) Do DNAm signals reflect changes in biological pathways that lead to breast cancer? 3) Do Black women have more or different exposures in the womb and are the consequences worse because of neighborhood stressors, experiences of discrimination, and resulting cumulative life stress? 3) Are there environmental chemical exposures in midlife that magnify effects of exposures in the womb and are these more intense in Black women? Research Methods. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRM) is a new technology to measure thousands of chemicals in blood. So, it is now possible to find chemicals in mothers’ pregnancy blood that link to daughters’ breast cancer that no one suspected before. Through other funding, we are completing HRM in mothers’ pregnancy blood and in daughters’ midlife blood in a 2-generation study of Alzheimer’s disease in the Child Health and Development Studies pregnancy cohort. Here we propose to add measures of DNAm in daughters’ blood samples that were previously collected in midlife. Then we will link exposures in the womb to our existing data on neighborhood stressors, age at menarche, obesity, lifetime stress and to the new DNAm measures. The study sample has an equal number of Black and white women creating a rare opportunity for a two-generation study that includes existing measures of exposures in the womb and midlife combined with information on neighborhood and cumulative lifetime stress. Innovation and Impact. We will find new environmental chemicals that could transmit breast cancer risk from mother to daughter during the mother’s pregnancy, learn whether these are higher in Black women, whether neighborhood, lifetime stress and exposures in midlife magnify risk from exposures in the womb. This new evidence will support ways to intervene early in life to reduce inequities over generations and may reveal some midlife strategies.

Research questions. 1) What are the most commonly used FHPs on the market and what lower toxicity alternatives exist? 2) What is the true chemical make-up of these products and alternatives and how do they deviate from listed ingredients? 3) How can we most effectively frame and structure our participant survey questions to gather information on their current use of feminine hygiene products and other relevant information? General methodology. We will establish a community-research partnership to collaborate with stakeholders and the community at large on research design, implementation, and dissemination. We will conduct analyses capable of detecting 200+ chemicals on a diverse set of 25 commonly used FHPs plus 25 alternatives with no listed BCRC ingredients for analyses. We will compare analytical results with the products’ ingredients lists and describe breast cancer-relevant exposures. We will develop participant surveys to be administered before and after the intervention period to capture current FHP use, demographics, and other relevant information. Innovative elements. The contribution of FHPs to breast cancer risk has not yet been explored. Our proposed project will be the first to conduct an intervention study on the effect of FHP use on BCRC biomarkers or to use comprehensive chemical analyses on a set of FHPs. It will be the first project funded by CBCRP to focus on FHPs.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Kimberly Berger,,,,Sequoia Foundation,https://ror.org/02acb4z65,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-08-01,Issued,,B30AB8580,award-number,,,,,,

More VA men tend to smoke cigarettes than other groups, placing VA women at high risk for SHSe. Despite the prevalent SHSe among VA women, there is a gap in research on this topic with regards to the cultural, historical and familial contexts within the VA community. Thus, our study seeks to explore multilevel determinants of SHSe as a breast cancer risk factor among VA women.

Latina breast cancer (BC) patients living in rural areas have many challenges (e.g., language barriers, lack of knowledge, transportation) in accessing and utilizing financial resources. Financial navigation (FN), a structured intervention to assist patients in accessing financial resources, has been considered a helpful intervention. Previous studies have found that the FN program is feasible and beneficial for cancer patients, but to our knowledge, no feasibility study has been conducted with Latina BC patients in rural regions. Kern County Cancer Foundation (KCCF)-San Diego State University (SDSU) partnership aims to refine and expand the existing KCCF FN program to target Latina BC patients who live in rural areas and examine if it is feasible and effective in addressing financial toxicity. Research questions include: 1) Is the culturally targeted FN program feasible and acceptable? and 2) Will the FN program reduce financial distress and increase health-related quality of life? In Phase I, we will adapt intervention elements and materials (e.g., brochures and handouts) to fit the Latina BC patients based on feedback from three focus groups (n=24) (Aim 1). Focus group participants will discuss the clarity of information, appropriateness of the format, and layout of the materials. In Phase II, we will conduct one group pre-posttest pilot trial with 60 Latina BC patients. The FN intervention comprises 6 modules, including an introduction and FN intake module, three core service modules (e.g., financial assistance program), an education/coaching module, and an ending session. This intervention will be offered via a mobile van in rural areas. All patients will receive two weekly in-person sessions, followed by three phone calls over a period of 3 months by two full-time bilingual/bicultural financial navigators. We will assess if the FN intervention is feasible and acceptable (Aim 2) and if the intervention reduces financial distress and increases health-related quality of life (Aim 3).

Like an onion, there are several layers that require peeling to understand the complete picture of this disease. While the disease impacts people of different races, ethnicities and cultural backgrounds, Black women are impacted the most. For example, Black women are more likely to die from the disease, they get diagnosed later, and may not have the same access to healthcare as White women. Scientists have some ideas as to why there are these differences between different groups and one of those developing ideas is related to environmental exposures from everyday use of personal care products. There are chemicals in our products that have been shown to be harmful to people’s health, including putting some people at risk of breast cancer. Because of research, we now understand that Black women and girls are exposed to these chemicals at earlier ages than other groups and these chemicals are connected to breast cancer development and advancement of this disease. Unfortunately, research information often does not reach communities quickly enough for solutions to be developed. In fact, the time gap between when research is conducted and when communities can use the information is about 17 years. The communities that would benefit the most from learning more about this information are often left out of these discussions. When Black communities are engaged in these educational efforts, we know that knowledge also increases which is a good first step towards improving people’s lives for the better. So, we—Celebrate Life Cancer Ministry (CLCM) and the Bench to Community Initiative (BCI)—are bringing together researchers, health advocates, breast cancer survivors or thrivers, community-based organizations, and media representatives to a virtual symposium to learn about these harmful chemicals and breast cancer risk with an emphasis on Black women and girls. The symposium will be on three separate days in September and people will learn about new research on this topic and receive practical skills and resources on reducing their exposures to these harmful chemicals and breast cancer risk.

In the statewide survey and eight regional meetings, participants emphasized the desire for culturally tailored, community-led education and advocacy materials to help communities understand how their priorities impact breast cancer risk and other health harms. Environmental health literacy (EHL) empowers communities to understand environmental health impacts, take individual actions to reduce their risk, and act collectively at the community level. EHL encompasses the wide range of skills needed to take environmental health information and make informed decisions, improve quality of life, reduce health risks, and protect the environment. At the CLASP-BC Phase 1 regional meetings, groups working on food security, safe bike lanes, and water quality often didn't see the link between their work and breast cancer prevention until BCPP covered the science behind the project's 15 breast cancer risk factors. Communities consistently expressed the need for this information in accessible formats. Any collective action to prevent breast cancer must start with the community understanding the impact of their risk factors. Materials must be provided in multiple languages and formats, including graphics and videos for communities with low literacy or non-written languages, and be delivered by trusted messengers. With this Planning Grant, BCPP will work with community groups, health practitioners, and academics to identify 2-3 underserved, high-risk communities that would most benefit from culturally tailored breast cancer prevention materials.

The practice has been to cap these soils at the surface with concrete or clay to keep rain from mobilizing the contaminants. However, in coastal areas the process of rising sea level will push shallow groundwater up at many locations, potentially mobilizing these contaminants from below. Mobilized VOCs can enter indoor air via sewer connections or openings in building foundations and expose people to chemicals associated with increased risk of breast cancer (Miller et al 2020, Kay et al 2024). One study found more than 1,400 sites with contaminants over rising groundwater in the San Francisco Bay Area alone (Hill et al 2023). Most are in underserved areas where people are already exposed to higher levels of pollution. Recent wet winters may have already mobilized contaminants at some sites, since rain can seasonally elevate shallow groundwater by several feet. Groundwater monitoring is absent or very limited, and it is not designed to register maximum levels or check for movement of contaminants offsite. We will use the Full Award to develop a method that would allow government agencies to systematically identify buildings where people are now or may in the near future be at risk of VOC penetration by contaminants associated with increased risk of breast cancer that originate in groundwater. During the Planning Grant, we will pilot our methods on the south Richmond shoreline in the San Francisco Bay Area, where VOCs are known to be present in groundwater and where occupied buildings are connected to sewer lines in the flow path of VOCs. This pilot has three goals: first, to develop a mapping process that identifies sewer lines at risk of VOC infiltration and buildings at risk of indoor air penetration. Second, we will develop a dialogue within our team about methods for sewer and indoor air monitoring in preparation for the Full Proposal.

Nearly 1 million Californians lack safe drinking water, and two-thirds of failing water systems are in low-income, underserved communities. A previous CBCRP-funded drinking water study conducted by UC Davis detected several contaminants in California drinking water linked to breast cancer, such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 1,2,3-trichloropropane, and di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). We plan to build upon the UC Davis drinking water project into underserved communities in the Central Valley and/or Central Coast of California. These regions are disproportionately impacted by groundwater contamination due to their close proximity to agricultural fields, oil extraction sites, landfills, hazardous waste sites, or other industrial areas. Some of the small communities in these regions receive bottled water as a short-term solution. However, this type of solution risks exposure to phthalate compounds and a long-term, affordable and sustainable solution is essential for reducing exposures and improving health and quality of life in these populations. Our proposed Full Award project aims to monitor water contaminants, create culturally relevant educational materials, and develop a community-level intervention that will benefit those impacted by contaminated water and ultimately reduce breast cancer risk. Engaging community members at every stage of the project is imperative to ensure long-term success; thus, during the Planning Grant, we will build relationships with community organizations and members in the regions. For example, the Community Water Center is a community-based organization and is currently engaged in efforts to implement 1,2,3-trichloropropane treatment for domestic wells and small water systems.

The research that has produced this evidence has been limited to studying one single chemical at a time. However, women are exposed to multiple chemicals simultaneously. It is unknown whether exposures to chemical mixtures have a larger effect on breast cancer risk than exposure to single chemicals. Biological markers (biomarkers) of exposure are needed to serve as an indication of past or current exposure. DNA methylation is a biomarker that changes in response to environmental exposures. DNA methylation is a reversible chemical process that regulates the activity of genes. HYPOTHESES 1. Exposure to mixtures of toxic chemicals is associated with higher risk for breast cancer compared to exposure to single chemicals 2. DNA methylation biomarkers can serve as a biomarker of exposure to chemical mixtures that increase breast cancer risk. METHODS We will measure the abundance of thousands of chemicals in archived blood samples of 300 women who developed breast cancer and 300 samples of women who did not. We will examine which chemicals have higher abundance in women who developed breast cancer. We will then create mixtures by grouping chemicals based on their impact on human health and other factors. We will then examine whether exposure to each mixture increases breast cancer risk and identify which of the chemicals in each mixture has the greatest impact on risk. All blood samples will also be sent for DNA methylation array analysis. We will then investigate whether there are specific DNA sites that are different among women with high total exposure to all the chemicals in a mixture and investigate which biological process are affected.

Although the number of BCa deaths has decreased over time, it is still one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in women overall and the most common among Hispanic women. Early detection of BCa via screening programs has helped reduce mortality. Imaging modalities such as contrast enhanced mammography (CEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have greatly improved BCa detection; however, these modalities are not suitable for routine screening due to high cost, limited availability or exposure to radiation and contrast agents. 2D mammography (2D MG) has been routinely used for BCa screening; however, it has a high false positive rate, a high false negative rate and cannot provide clinical insight until a lesion is visible on imaging, which limits early detection. Volumetric mammographic imaging of the breast using digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has been reported to improve BCa detection; however, DBT is associated with a higher radiation exposure to the patient. The increased availability of artificial intelligence (AI) and imaging informatics tools have made it possible to detect pre-malignancy signal and triage women with different risk profiles.

A successful example is the use of PARP inhibitors to treat patients with harmful BRCA mutations. Unfortunately, even with targeted therapy, the development of drug resistance poses a significant challenge. Our research proposal aims to generate new therapeutics that will address this problem. DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) has emerged as a promising target for developing a new class of drugs for breast cancer treatment. POLQ levels are abnormally high in 70% of breast cancers, particularly those with poor prognosis, including the triple negative breast cancer. These tumor cells rely on POLQ to survive, especially under conditions of cell stress, whereas normal cells do not depend on POLQ for viability. We have shown that by inhibiting POLQ, we can also kill BRCA variant tumors that have acquired PARP inhibitor resistance. To become an effective treatment for patients, POLQ inhibitors still face the challenge of maintaining sufficient levels in the body to kill cancer cells. In this study, we will use a powerful new tool known as click chemistry (which is a pioneering method of joining molecules together to manufacture new drugs), developed by Dr. Barry Sharpless (2022 Nobel Prize Chemistry).

TNBC frequently recurs after standard breast cancer treatment. Few targeted treatments are available for TNBC, and they are limited in scope and effectiveness, and have adverse side effects. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need to develop new targeted therapies that would prevent metastasis and benefit many women with TNBC. We have identified a protein, t-SATB1, that we hypothesize to be a promising target for TNBC therapy based on the following innovative discoveries. We found that this protein is expressed specifically in breast cancer cells with high metastatic activity, and not in healthy cells. We identified a specific messenger RNA (mRNA) that cells use to produce this protein and devised a method to specifically degrade this mRNA to eliminate this protein in metastatic breast cancer cells. Indeed, this method readily kills TNBC cells grown in cell culture, showing that tumor cells can be effectively eliminated. Further, when we injected TNBC cells into the blood stream of mice, our targeted-elimination method blocked TNBC cells from growing in the lungs to form new tumors in mice, preventing metastasis. Using an approach called “xenograft,” we propose to implant piece of human tumor donated by TNBC patients in the breast of mice and test the efficacy of our approach. We hypothesize that t-SATB1 elimination will block metastasis. We will also monitor safety of our approach by studying any side effects, both at the organism health level as well as at the gene expression level. Because the targeted protein is not present in normal cells, we expect that side effects will be minimal. If our research is successful, we anticipate that our approach may lay the critical groundwork to develop a new type of targeted therapy for TNBC to effectively block metastatic recurrence while minimizing adverse effects of treatment, thus saving many lives. Because t-SATB1 is found in other types of aggressive breast cancers, we anticipate that our approach may be readily applied more broadly, and our antibody that detects t-SATB1 will be a useful diagnostic tool to identify patients who may benefit from this treatment.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Terumi Kohwi-Shigematsu,,,,"University of California, San Francisco",https://ror.org/043mz5j54,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-08-01,Issued,,B30IB8499,award-number,,,,,,

Imagine cancer cells as tiny invaders that navigate through the body, seeking new territories. What if we could interfere with their navigation system, making it harder for them to spread? Our project is at the forefront of this exciting possibility, focusing on breast cancer, a type that affects millions worldwide and is the most common cancer in women in the US. Our research focuses on filopodia, cellular ""fingers"" guiding movement through tumor-surrounding areas. These ""fingers"" help cancer cells decide where to move, especially through the dense and stiff areas around tumors. Our goal is to find a way to halt these fingers, stopping breast cancer cells from moving and spreading. Our team has discovered a promising substance, which we refer to as #26, that can do just that. It targets and blocks the action of filopodia, showing great potential in preventing the spread of breast cancer cells without harming the body's healthy cells. This discovery could revolutionize how we approach breast cancer treatment, offering hope for strategies that prevent cancer from reaching other body parts. How are we doing this? Through a series of experiments that combine biology and chemistry, we are testing how well #26 can stop breast cancer cells in their tracks and exploring how #26 affect cancer cells' ability to sense and respond to their environment, aiming to understand exactly how they work. What makes our project innovative is the discovery of #26, and our approach in studying its effects and potential. If successful, we could identify new treatments that specifically target the ability of cancer cells to spread, opening up new avenues for preventing metastasis in breast cancer. The impact of our work could be significant, offering new hope for treatments that go beyond current methods, focusing on stopping cancer from spreading rather than just shrinking tumors.

We hypothesize that exposure to pathogens cause breast cancer and breast cancer lethality. This is because pathogens, particularly those that establish infection in the breast, demonstrate many carcinogenic qualities such as driving chronic inflammation and mutations to the DNA. Yet, research has not been conducted to learn which types of infection act as carcinogens and put populations at risk for breast cancer and breast cancer being lethal. Our lab has designed an innovative multi-omics pipeline to trace infections with pathogens that act as carcinogens in clinical trial datasets. This is important because these exposures are frequent and pathogen exposures initiate cancer hallmarks and change the types of treatments that would work for patients. Our study recruits patients who have infection and breast cancer; which allows us to specifically study at risk patients. Our novel preclinical studies of breast cancer and infection will show us how exposure to pathogens can cause breast cancer hallmarks and lethality. In our study we test and deliver new concepts for preventative strategies to minimize risk of breast cancer by blocking pathogen driven cancer hallmarks like tumor promoting inflammation and tumor blood vessel formation eliminate cancer risk. We also design novel combination immune checkpoint treatments and use them with interventions specific for comorbid infection. This is important because these patients have diminished immune function– but no studies have been done on how to restore the ability of their immune system to recognize and kill breast cancer cells. We close this gap by delineating treatments that restore anti-tumor and anti-pathogen immune function. As an outcome of these results and this study, we will impact breast cancer prevention, treatment, community engagement, and political policy by providing clear data on which types of infectious exposures put people at risk for lethal breast cancer. Therefore, this study will motivate action to implement new concepts for how breast cancer initiates and progresses and effective prevention and treatment strategies to block the ability of pathogens to cause breast cancer or make breast cancer lethal.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Daniel Hollern,,,,Salk Institute for Biological Studies,https://ror.org/03xez1567,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-03-01,Issued,,B30MP8502,award-number,,,,,,

Firefighter cancer research has focused on male cohorts, with little study of women. However, in epidemiological studies that included some female firefighters, nearly half of all cancers were breast cancers and breast cancer incidence was higher than in the general public. Hence, our team is studying the exposures and biological mechanisms that increase breast cancer risk among female firefighters. Measuring early biomarkers of cancer can help identify causes, and new methods are needed. In its 2023 Monographs, IARC noted strong mechanistic evidence of DNA damage (genotoxicity) associated with occupational exposure as a firefighter. This is unsurprising because products of combustion are genotoxic, however there are likely other important exposures contributing to mutations and breast cancer. Since mutations are an intermediate step between DNA damage and cancer, and can also result from non-genotoxic processes, assessing mutations may provide a more predictive biomarker for cancer risk. We propose to measure the burden and patterns of mutations associated with firefighting using two comparisons: 1) female firefighters compared to matched office workers and 2) female firefighters at recruitment baseline and after 2-3 years of firefighting. Using novel and highly accurate error-corrected DNA sequencing technology, we will measure mutation frequency and identify mutational signatures overrepresented among firefighters. We will compare these signatures to a reference database and our previous exposure measurements to predict which occupational exposures most likely caused the mutations. To further refine predictions of mutagenic chemicals in smoke, we will use computational approaches to model DNA lesions caused by this class of chemicals. Our research supports breast cancer prevention by applying a novel technology to identify early biomarkers predictive of risk. Our team will support firefighter risk reduction throughout the project.

One in ten breast cancer patients is of reproductive age when they are diagnosed. Young breast cancer patients are at risk of infertility from cancer treatments due to direct ovarian toxicity from alkylating and platinating chemotherapy, sterilization from removing ovaries, and/or reproductive aging during prolonged time on hormone therapy. Fertility preservation before breast cancer treatment can decrease infertility risks. Patients want to learn about their risks, engage in shared decision-making on fertility preservation, and do fertility preservation when appropriate. Oncofertility care involves educating patients about reproductive risks and fertility preservation and providing access to fertility preservation services. Because oncofertility care doesn’t reach many patients, many policies from state laws like Senate Bill 600 that require health insurance plans to cover fertility preservation to fertility clinic policies to facilitate care have been enacted, but we lack a summary of policies and their effectiveness in promoting delivery of oncofertility care. Thus, we lack the evidence to make sound policies in this area.

Most mammograms are now three-dimentional (3D) tomography exams, which have more than 50 pictures of each breast instead of just a single two-dimentional picture. These 3D exams require longer interpretation times, leading to further exhaustion for radiologists, longer patient wait times, delays in breast cancer diagnoses, and poor quality of care. While artificial intelligence tools may improve accuracy, its impact on interpretation time and radiologists' well-being remains unknown. We will conduct a two-year randomized clinical trial on the impact of artificial intelligence on screening mammography accuracy involving over 90,000 exams at UCLA Health. We will assess whether artificial intelligence will catch cancers missed by radiologists and reduce false positives. During the trial radiologists will interpret half of the images with and half without artificial intelligence support. For this California Breast Cancer Research Program award, we propose adding new data collection during the trial to allow us to study the concurrent impact of artificial intelligence on efficiency and wait times. We aim to determine if artificial intelligence helps radiologists interpret mammograms faster without compromising accuracy and if it can reduce their fatigue and burnout. We will begin by consulting UCLA breast radiologists and surveying California practitioners to get their perspectives on artificial intelligence tools. Collaborating with patient advocates, we'll ensure the survey captures patient-centric concerns. We will also track interpretation time during the trial, allowing us to evaluate efficiency along with accuracy, while post-trial discussions will provide insight into radiologists' experiences. Our study will offer new insights into integrating artificial intelligence tools into breast cancer screening, informing real-world practice. By understanding artificial intelligence’s impact on efficiency and burnout, we aim to optimize its implementation statewide, empowering radiologists to focus on complex cases, patient care, and diverse communities.

This wealth of expertise was applied to three focus areas: 1) new drugs and treatments that can be used on tumors that are found early; 2) using imaging and other methods to find early indicators of breast cancer; 3) highlight important research about the biology of breast cancer and of the hormonal cycle control in women. As our understanding of breast cancer and hormonal management improves, we should use this knowledge to upgrade the hormonal control products that millions of women take over the course of their lifetime with a goal of reducing breast cancer incidence. In the second year, we will build upon the progress and research presented, continuing to push the field forward.

The transduction of the Hh signaling relies on the primary cilium, a tiny cell surface organelle that functions as the hub of cell signaling. To reveal new cilium proteins related to the Hh pathway, we have conducted a proximity-based proteomic studies, and uncovered novel cilium proteins. In this proposal, we will focus on one of the novel cilium proteins, Numb, to reveal its regulatory mechanism in the Hh pathway and the Hh-related tumor growth. Previous studies on Numb implicate this protein in asymmetric cell division and regulation of multiple signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanism of how Numb participates in these cellular processes remains controversial. Our discovery of Numb’s localization in the primary cilium may help elucidate the unknown mechanisms. We found that Numb loss of function leads to accumulation of a Hh transcription regulator, Gli3 repressor (Gli3R). For Hh pathway to be turned on, the Gli3R has to be degraded. Numb has been described as an adaptor protein that links target proteins to the E3 ligase, Itch. Therefore, we hypothesize that Numb is required to switch on the Hh signaling by degrading Gli3R. We will test this hypothesis via the following Aims: 1) Determine roles of Numb as an adaptor of ubiquitin ligase for Gli3R; 2) Identify roles of Numb in the proliferation and differentiation of granule neuron precursors in the developing cerebellum; 3) Determine roles of Numb in the formation of medulloblastoma in mouse models.

Aberrant transcriptional expression and epigenetic changes are common in cancer cells compared to normal cells. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently captured the interest of many researchers due to their ability to act as regulators and organizers of gene expression in the cell. We have identified a set of five conserved long non-coding RNAs required for cancer cell survival, based on data mining of screens for cancer associated long non-coding RNAs, and several published CRISPR-Cas9 screens of thousands of non-coding RNAs. Some of these lncRNAs have been studied previously in the context of cancer metastasis and progression, but the pathways in which they function are still unknown. We have developed a powerful mass spectrometry screen for specific lncRNA interacting factors that enables the identification of direct, zero-distance interactors with an RNA of interest. This method has already been successfully used to characterize the interacting factors of Xist lncRNA in embryonic stem cells, but no cancer related experiments have so far been performed. The experiments in this proposal will extend the method to cancer cell related lncRNAs, with the potential to discover a new set of regulatory roles for non-coding RNAs. Using this seed funding, we will explore the molecular basis for the observed cell growth phenotypes by establishing a knockdown and overexpression system for each of the five conserved lncRNAs. We will characterize the protein interactome and transcriptional changes induced by overexpression or deletion of each of these five conserved lncRNAs.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy alone has shown limited improvement in survival and immunotherapeutics have not shown great success in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRLM. While progress has been made in relevant research models, there is an unmet need to incorporate immune cell interactions into these models. Current ex-vivo oncologic models lack the milieu of non-cancerous components that influence a tumor including: 1) Primary colorectal cells do not survive in 2D cultures, 2) simple organoids do not adequately mimic essential features of the tumor microenvironment (TME) 3) murine models and patient-derived xenografts are costly and lack an intact immune response, and 4) syngeneic mouse models lack a human target and do not facilitate the development of the chronic inflammatory environment characteristic of human tumors, which can stimulate immunologic inhibitory pathways.

Curative intent external beam radiation therapy (RT) for PCa has been historically delivered in the form of low daily doses, or fractions, of RT over a total of 39 to 45 fractions. Because PCa cells appear to be preferentially killed by higher doses of RT per fraction (even if to a lower total overall dose), the modern technique of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) allows the treatment course to be condensed to as short as five fractions. However, while the rates of significant genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity are similar between SBRT and longer RT courses, it is unknown which patients are predisposed towards developing significant toxicity following either treatment. Given the higher doses per day delivered with SBRT, trepidation towards its use persist. Variants in germline DNA (i.e., DNA that is inherited and intrinsic to any given person) are thought to strongly influence a given patient's response to RT. We have significant data from a translational study of over 200 men that suggest that biomarker panels defined by single nucleotide polymorphisms in germline DNA predict significant genitourinary toxicity after longer-course RT or SBRT with a high level of accuracy. A practically relevant aspect of examining germline DNA is that any type of biological sample taken from a patient, such as an easily obtained cheek swab, would contain enough material for analysis. The project being proposed for a New Assistant Professor Faculty Seed Grant from the University of California Cancer Research Coordinating Committee is an innovative prospective clinical trial termed the “Germline DNA-Based Radiosensitivity Biomarker Influence on Decisions About and Toxicity Following Prostate Radiotherapy” (GARUDA) trial.

This discipline is the study of how “spelling” mistakes in the RNA, rather than the DNA, contribute to cancer development. I will examine whether spelling mistakes in the RNA contribute to the development of a specific cancer, synovial sarcoma. Synovial sarcomas are rare aggressive cancers of the muscle tissue that often affect adolescents and young adults. These cancers are invariably associated with an abnormality of chromosomes 18 and X (translocation t(X:18; p11:q11)), producing a chimeric protein SS18-SSX. While the presence of this chimeric protein ultimately results in abnormal gene regulation (how genes are turned on and turned off), the exact mechanism by which this occurs is still unknown. Proteins that modify the sequence of RNA have recently emerged as an important class of gene regulators. They act at the level of RNA metabolism and translation and can affect the expression of cancer genes. However, the role of RNA modification defects in the development of synovial sarcoma is completely unknown. I hypothesize that abnormal modifications of the RNA contribute to the gene regulation changes that cause synovial sarcoma development. To address this hypothesis, I will examine the expression of RNA-modifying proteins in synovial sarcomas using the RNA sequence information from over 30 synovial sarcoma tumors, over 12,000 other cancers, and over 100 normal tissues that my laboratory previously assembled. I will then use a technology called nanopore direct RNA sequencing to characterize the landscape of RNA modifications in a panel of 30 synovial sarcoma tumor samples and patient-derived cell cultures. Finally, I will correlate the expression of RNA-modifying proteins to the catalog of RNA modifications to identify synovial sarcoma-specific patterns; I will use these patterns to develop further hypotheses about the role of RNA modifications in tumor development.

While lacking a BCR-ABL fusion, nearly 65% of Ph-like ALL cases carry a rearrangement in the cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) gene located on both X and Y chromosomes, the most common being a chromosomal translocation with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (CRLF2-IgH) resulting in increased and uncontrolled expression of CRLF2 that correlates with reduced survival. CRLF2 rearrangements are significantly higher in patients of Latin descent, indicating this is a high-risk group for Ph-like ALL and that understanding the molecular mechanisms driving CRLF2 rearrangements would greatly benefit prediction and diagnosis of Ph-like ALL. Our recent analysis of over 2,000 translocation breakpoints in human patients revealed that DNA double-strand-breaks (DSBs) that initiate the CRLF2-IgH translocations can occur within a 25 kb region upstream of the gene but are enriched 36-fold in a 311 bp cluster region and involve the B cell-specific mutator activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Tight clustering of breakpoints indicates a non-random mechanism underlying DSB formation and elucidation of this mechanism would fill a crucial knowledge gap regarding the etiology of Ph-like ALL. Our central hypothesis is that CRLF2 DSBs occur through a defined mechanism that involves abnormal AID levels in an early pre-B cell stage and altered epigenetics that makes AID a more potent mutator and DSB initiator. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursing two specific aims: (1) Use our novel molecular assay to determine the mechanism of CRLF2-IgH translocations and (2) Compare the genomic DNA from B cells of Latino and non-Latino populations for genetic and epigenetic risk markers linked to CRLF2 rearrangements.

As a first step towards understanding CRC, it is crucial to understand the biology of the organ the cancer develops in. The inner mucosal layer of the intestine is comprised of an array of different epithelial cell types, which are organized in crypt structures. At the base of each crypt are non-quiescent epithelial stem cells that rapidly differentiate into progenitor cells. To determine how the transcriptome and proteome keep pace with rapid differentiation, we developed a new cell sorting method to purify mouse colon epithelial cells. We showed that alternative pre-mRNA splicing and alternative polyadenylation dominate changes in the transcriptome as stem cells differentiate into progenitors. By contrast, as progenitors differentiate into mature cell types, changes in mRNA levels rather than different isoforms dominate the transcriptome. These observations demonstrated that during the first steps in loss of stemness, the most notable change in the transcriptome are changes in mRNA isoform production via alternative splicing events and/or alternative polyadenylation. Considering that the disruption of cellular differentiation and the promotion of rapid proliferation is a crucial step in initiating carcinogenesis, it is likely that CRC may originate from an inability of crypt stem cells to initiate the necessary alternative pre-mRNA processing programs that guide terminal differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesize that defects in alternative pre-mRNA processing contributes to the origin of CRC. To demonstrated that that the lack of differentiation-specific alternative pre-mRNA processing is an early hallmark of CRC, we plan to define the transcriptomes of colon stem cells and daughter cells harvested from a CRC mouse model. Furthermore, to demonstrate that equivalent alternative pre-mRNA processing changes accompany differentiation of human CRC cells, we will analyze the transcriptomes of CRC crypt organoids derived from human patients in the context of stemness and metabolically-induced differentiation.

Dysregulation of post-transcriptional control and translational machinery have been implicated in malignant tumor development. One of the mechanisms to govern translation is cytoplasmic polyadenylation, and recent evidence suggests that this process modulates gene reprogramming associated with cancer progression. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEB1-CPEB4) are sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins that act as a translational regulator to control poly(A) tail elongation of target mRNAs, and subsequently contribute to phenotypic changes in cancer cells. Among CPEBs, aberrant expression of CPEB3 has been shown in several types of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and glioma. Importantly, a self-cleaving hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme was identified in the CPEB3 gene. While we have previously uncovered the role of CPEB3 ribozyme in memory formation in mice, the regulation of CPEB3 ribozyme in transcriptional machinery implicated in cancer cells remains unexplored. Given the fact that CPEB3 acts as a tumor suppression gene, and downregulation of CPEB3 promotes cancer progression, we hypothesize that CPEB3 ribozyme might regulate CPEB3 expression and subsequently modulate tumorigenesis. In our preliminary studies from analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), we have found that CPEB3 expression is correlated with survival in low-grade glioma, melanoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. The proposed pilot study aims to elucidate whether the CPEB3 ribozyme plays a role in tumor development and progression. In Aim 1: We will investigate CPEB3 ribozyme self-cleaving activity and identify whether the ribozyme facilitates full-length mRNA processing and protein expression in cancer cells. In Aim 2: We will determine tumor suppression effects of CPEB3 by inhibiting CPEB3 ribozyme, and understand the underlying mechanisms associated with cancer metastasis through post-transcriptional regulation by CPEB3.

Leveraging TAM plasticity to promote pro-inflammatory functions holds great promise against tumors. However, the mechanisms that regulate TAM plasticity in vivo have not been studied extensively because of a dearth of appropriate mouse models. To fill this gap, we just generated a mouse strain that allows us to map the fate of IL12b-producing (pro-inflammatory) TAMs towards IL-10-producing (anti-inflammatory) ones. This application aims to use our new mouse strain to gain insights into the mechanisms of plasticity regulating the stability of the pro-inflammatory function of TAMs in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that the pro-inflammatory activity of TAMs can be induced by immunotherapy but is short-lived because the tumor microenvironment efficiently re-programs them to become anti-inflammatory. In Aim 1, we will determine the sequence and dynamics of TAM functional changes during the transition from pro- to anti-inflammatory. We will also explore the molecular mechanisms that might regulate the loss of the pro-inflammatory state in vivo by running RNA and ATAC sequencing on TAMs sorted based on their function. In Aim 2, we will measure TAM plasticity from pro- to anti-inflammatory phenotypes in tumors with varying degrees of immunogenicity and after the administration of various immune-stimulating therapies. The expected outcome of this project is to gain insight into the extent, duration, and potential mechanisms by which the tumor re-programs pro-inflammatory macrophages to become anti-inflammatory, supporting its progression.

IDH mutant gliomas are for the most part distinct from glioblastomas, a type of diffuse glioma that is the most common adult brain cancer. IDH mutant gliomas can be further separated into astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas based on the absence or presence, respectively, of the 1p19q chromosomal co-deletion. IDH mutant astrocytomas are ~2-3 times more common than oligodendrogliomas. The process of malignant transformation [2], albeit poorly defined and characterized, represents a common transition in which low grade gliomas adopt a more aggressive and treatment resistant phenotype, ultimately leading to death. Malignant transformation is diminished or significantly delayed in many oligodendroglioma patients, and as a result, many but not all, oligodendroglioma patients treated with radiation and chemotherapy can experience long survivals approximating cure. This is not the case for the majority of astrocytoma patients. While astrocytomas can be controlled for intervals ranging from 5-15 years, almost inevitably, astrocytomas will undergo malignant transformation becoming more aggressive and treatment resistant. With improved understanding of the process of malignant transformation, we expect to be able to predict and ultimately prevent malignant transformation. Specifically, we will examine the role of recently available IDH mutant inhibitors now in trials for glioma [3] in altering malignant transformation and whether IDH mutant inhibition has a role in gliomas post malignant transformation.

However, previous studies have found low adherence to these guidelines in cancer survivors. Dietary recommendations designed specifically for cancer patients are often based on inclusive, conflicting, or non-existing medical evidence, which is the primary source of confusion and frustration. We intend to design a randomized controlled trial which is an individualized diet-related small habits (DISHs) intervention program for cancer survivors.

The objective of the current study is to examine the feasibility of the main trial. In this study, we will estimate the capability of recruitment of CCCS (clinically cured cancer survivors) in communities through different sources; evaluate questionnaires for measuring DISHs perception and collecting of data that are associated with barriers to unhealthy dietary behaviors; assess questionnaires for measuring adherence of DISHs; investigate the approach to collect biological specimens; evaluate the performance of training the MLA models for personalized DISHs; and ultimately estimate the cost, time and manpower as a whole.

Relapsed/refractory T-ALL is often enriched with leukemia initiating cells (LICs), which exhibit enhanced survival and self-renewal capacity. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) plays a key regulatory role in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, the innate immune response, and cancer. We discovered that ADAR1-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is crucial for the maintenance of T-ALL LIC. Preliminary studies revealed that approximately 70% of T-ALL patients exhibit high expression of ADAR1, and this is associated with significantly worse clinical outcome. In addition, inhibition of ADAR1 impairs LIC survival and self-renewal in patient-derived in vitro and in vivo models. An important function of A-to-I RNA editing is to suppress interferon (IFN)-induced apoptosis by dsRNA sensing and to prevent activation of the innate immune response. Inosine-containing endogenous dsRNA is recognized as “self” by dsRNA-sensing pathways to distinguish from invading viral dsRNA. In this manner, ADAR1 prevents activation of dsRNA sensors, such as melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and protein kinase R (PKR), which in turn trigger inflammation signals. We were excited to confirm that ADAR1 suppresses inflammation pathways by limiting the cytosolic dsRNA pool in T-ALL LICs. This occurs through both hyper-editing of IFN-associated RNAs and retention of nuclear dsRNA via an RNA editing-independent mechanism. However, whether the ADAR1-directed, dsRNA-sensing pathway contributes to LIC maintenance has never been studied. To test this, we will first determine if ADAR1 knockdown activates aberrant dsRNA sensing by quantifying the level and cellular location of dsRNA. In addition, concurrent knockdown of dsRNA sensors (PKR and MDA5) in combination with ADAR1 knockout in LICs will be applied to determine if aberrant dsRNA sensing disrupts LIC self-renewal in patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, we will map dsRNA-containing genes suppressed by either RNA editing or dsRNA binding activity of ADAR1.

Treatment requires intensive chemotherapy, months-long hospitalization, and often bone marrow transplant. Despite this, relapses are common, and cure after relapse is rare. Better therapies for AML are sorely needed. Because we have reached the limit of what conventional approaches can offer, progress will depend on our discovering new, biologically rational approaches to this disease. We have chosen to approach this problem systematically by surveying the entire genome for new ways to kill AML cells. Virtually every form of cancer therapy kills tumor cells using a common biochemical pathway called apoptosis. Cancer drugs cause some form of cellular damage or stress, and this triggers the process of apoptosis to kill the cell. A gene called TP53 plays an important role in this process. TP53 acts as a sensor of cellular injury, and it triggers apoptosis when damage reaches a certain threshold. Mutations that disable TP53 make cells less prone to apoptosis, allowing them to persist despite treatment. TP53 mutations are therefore highly associated with relapse in AML and most other forms of cancer. We reason that new therapies might emerge from a broad survey of apoptosis regulation across the genome. We have conducted preliminary experiments studying a different type of cancer (rhabdomyosarcoma). We adapted cutting-edge CRISPR technology to identify genes that regulate BIM, one of several key proteins involved in the apoptosis process. Having validated this approach, we now plan to study AML with a broader version of this novel technology. With recent advances, we are now poised to study multiple proteins that work together in apoptosis. Some promote cell death (BAD, BID, BIM, and BAX), while others are protective (BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL1). Studying this protein family as a whole will be more useful than focusing on BIM alone, because apoptosis reflects the combined action of these components. In essence, we will identify pathways that increase pro-death proteins and reduce survival proteins in a panel of AML cell lines. By comparing cells that have a mutation in TP53 to cells with normal TP53, we will discover ways to trigger apoptosis regardless of TP53 status.

GLDC function is critical to tumor-initiating cells in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and it has been proposed as a promising drug target for lung cancer treatment. In spite of the urgent need to develop new lung-cancer chemotherapeutics, currently there is no GLDC inhibitor available that could allow researchers to validate the hypothesis regarding GLDC as an anti-cancer drug target. In this project, we aim to bridge this knowledge gap to develop the first GLDC-selective inhibitor(s). First, we will design mechanism-based inhibitors by harnessing the unique reactivity of aminooxy group towards PLP cofactor and mimicking GLDC’s unique substrate, lipoylated H-protein. We will use a “cap-linker-binder” modular approach to rapidly create a library of aminooxy-based inhibitors and map out the structure-activity relationship. Secondly, to further improve this first-generation of GLDC inhibitors, we will use a structure-guided approach. Since crystal structures of human GLDC are available, we will leverage the existing structure-determination protocols to study the crystal structure of GLDC-inhibitor complex. Moreover, as the protein-protein interaction between GLDC and H-protein is unknown, we will also use affinity-probe and chemoenzymatically modify H-protein in order to stabilize the GLDC-H protein complex for structural characterization. This co-crystal structure will provide critical insights for designing peptide inhibitors that can block the substrate entrance tunnel of GLDC. Furthermore, the approach also provides an opportunity to develop protein-protein interaction inhibitor or molecular glue-like inhibitors. Thirdly, as a complementary approach, we will also perform a phenotypical screening experiment to identify drug leads de novo. For example, we will use the phage-display technique to screen a large library of cyclic peptides and identify the initial peptide scaffolds or sequences that can bind to GLDC and also inhibit its activity.

They exert such pleiotropic effects by entering their target cells and activating intracellular nuclear receptors. Due to their lipophilic character, steroid hormones are believed to freely diffuse across cellular membranes in process called simple diffusion. Despite its frequent appearance in physiology textbooks, however, this model has never been experimentally demonstrated in any organism. Indeed, recent studies in our lab have shown that ecdysone, the primary steroid hormone in insects, requires membrane transporters to traverse the plasma membrane. These transporters, named ecdysone importers, all belong to the solute carrier organic anion (SLCO) transporter superfamily, which is highly conserved among metazoans including humans. In the proposed project, we aim to identify potential roles of SLCO transporters in androgen-dependent prostate cancer growth. In preliminary studies, we identified one SLCO transporter that is primarily responsible for testosterone incorporation into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, challenging the conventional paradigm that human steroid hormones are incorporated into cells by simple diffusion.

Stress also increases tumor progression by activating beta-adrenergic receptors causing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, promoting tumor cell invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Interfering with beta-adrenergic signaling inhibits tumor proliferation and survival. Epidemiological studies revealed that subjects who received beta-adrenergic antagonists for stress reduction showed a lower cancer rate. Combining beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists with the current standard of care therapies creates potent synergism leading to tumor remission. Beta-adrenergic receptors are highly expressed in glioblastomas (GBM) and correlate with poor prognosis. Preliminary results: Significant cell death occurs by beta2 receptor antagonism and disruption of primarily the beta2-arrestin pathway in three glioma cell lines. Selective beta2-antagonist, ICI 118551 showed, while biased G-protein agonist Salmeterol xinafoate revealed the highest efficacy. Zinterol, a balanced agonist (leading to activation of both G-protein and Beta-arrestin pathways), showed no cell death. Anti-apoptotic protein survivin was downregulated by beta-2-adrenergic signaling interference by salmeterol xinafoate.

As forces produced by mitotic motors are central to high mitotic fidelity in normal cells, full elucidation of the biochemical activities of human mitotic motors promises to provide insights into how high chromosome separation fidelity is achieved in healthy cells and is lost in cancer cells. Moreover, because cancer cell pathogenesis depends on mis-regulated proliferation, and because cancer cells exhibit enhanced sensitivity to mitotic inhibitors relative to normal cells, newly discovered mitotic motor activities are promising targets for development of new cancer therapies. Indeed, anti-mitotic compounds such as taxol are highly effective clinically. However, these anti-mitotics are dose-limited because they are not specific to mitotic cells. Here, we propose to adopt for human mitotic motors, a powerful biochemical assay system developed and used successfully in the applicant’s lab to identify new activities for yeast mitotic motors. This research will build a foundation for future studies to test the hypothesis that these mitotic motor activities are aberrant in certain cancers, and for development of biochemical assays designed to identify novel inhibitors of human mitotic motors for cancer chemotherapy. Such inhibitors would offer a larger therapeutic window than cancer drugs like taxol that target tubulin, because tubulin is not only present in mitotic spindles, but plays sundry roles in every cell in the body and is particularly crucial for function of neurons.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Georjana Barnes,,,,"University of California, Berkeley",https://ror.org/01an7q238,ROR,https://ror.org/,2023-10-01,Issued,,C24CR7388,award-number,,,,,,

These memory T cells stand poised to recognize the virus and fight subsequent infection with the same virus. In order to provide optimal protection, memory T cells patrol the body and look for infected cells by examining whether cells have viral pieces, or peptides, on the cell surface. For example, memory T cells that have formed during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic can recognize pieces of the spike peptide of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Spike-specific memory T cells will kill any cell that expresses viral spike proteins. Recent findings have shown that memory T cells even patrol tumor tissue. Of course, since tumor cells are not infected with virus, the virus-specific memory T cells that patrol tumor tissue will not harm the tumor cells. Our preliminary studies have found that administration of viral peptides into tumor tissue will make tumors resemble virus-infected cells, resulting in activation of virus-specific memory T cells that can kill the tumor; however, the effect is transient since the viral peptides undergo rapid degradation and clearance. If this response can be augmented and sustained, it could represent an innovative non-toxic approach to tumor immune therapy. In order to make tumor cells resemble infected cells, we propose to deliver self-amplifying mRNA vaccines into the tumor. These vaccines, similar to Moderna or Pfizer’s mRNA vaccines, will result in the production of spike peptides by tumor cells, rendering them immunogenic. Anti-COVID-19 responses will be directed towards the tumor and release tumor antigens to prime tumor-specific responses. We will test our approach using mouse models of viral infection and blood from COVID-19 patients known to have memory T cells specific for spike peptides.

Like many cancer treatments, effective responses are observed in only a minority of patients. Another way tumors suppress the immune response in their local environment is producing tryptophan metabolites via the kynurenine pathway. One of its enzymes is indole dioxygenase (IDO), for which inhibitors/drug candidates have been developed (epacadostat, indoximod). These entered clinical study, often combined with checkpoint inhibitors. For the most part, these have not shown desired efficacy, and IDO inhibitors have lost their luster. Understanding of how tryptophan metabolites suppress the immune response has recently expanded. Their activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in T-cells is key. Tryptophan-derived indole-3-pyruvate is a strong AHR activator. The enzyme that produces them is IL4I1. There is a greater correlation of immune suppression by a tumor to indole-3-pyruvate levels than kynurenic acid levels (a product of IDO), and only IL4I1 is needed to make indole-3-pyruvate. Therefore, IL4I1 is a more relevant target to the desired drug effect, overcoming tumor immune evasion. Activation of the AHR in tumor cells also stimulates their proliferation. So preventing AHR activator production has two benefits. The enzymatic mechanism of IL4I1 includes an essential flavin cofactor. Inhibitors of flavin enzymes have a long history in biochemistry. One particularly fruitful approach to targeting them is a classical, now almost forgotten strategy, mechanism-based inhibition. “Suicide inhibitors” typically lead to irreversible covalent enzyme modification. There are marketed drugs with this mode of action against flavin enzymes. While covalent drugs are currently fashionable, and also have success stories in cancer (like ibrutinib), there are distinct advantages to mechanism-based inhibitors. They must be acted upon by the enzyme to reveal a reactive functionality, providing very high specificity. We will take this approach to inhibiting IL4I1 that draws from a vast past literature on mechanism-based inhibition. An effective inhibitor of IL4I1 would be a worthy candidate to study in combination with checkpoint inhibitors for immuno-oncology.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Michael Pirrung,,,,"University of California, Riverside",https://ror.org/03nawhv43,ROR,https://ror.org/,2023-10-01,Issued,,C24CR7667,award-number,,,,,,

Despite great success in other cancers, current immunotherapies have shown minimal efficacy in human OSA, underscoring the need for novel immunotherapies for these aggressive cancers. Dogs are outbred companion animals that develop spontaneous cancers in the setting of an intact immune system, allowing for the study of complex immune interactions during cancer therapies while also addressing endpoints of efficacy and toxicity. Importantly, dog OSA shows remarkable homology to human OSA. We have exciting data that a subset of dogs with bulky pulmonary metastases from OSA can show tumor regression after only 14 days of inhaled recombinant human (rh) IL-15, including dogs with dramatic responses lasting 1 year. However, we have also observed that if we administer rhIL-15 after surgery in an earlier stage of disease, rhIL-15 is ineffective and appears to worsen outcomes, suggesting a tumor-promoting effect of rhIL-15 in the post-surgical setting. We now have provocative preliminary data that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) express the IL15 receptor alpha (IL15RA), suggesting these immunosuppressive cells may be able to sequester IL-15 and limit the anti-tumor activity of natural killer (NK) and memory T cells. Since surgery is known to induce IL-6, TGF-beta, and GM-CSF secretion, which all promote MDSC expansion, we hypothesize a link between surgery, MDSC expansion, and resistance to IL-15 immunotherapy. We will evaluate our hypothesis with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Evaluate circulating MDSC levels post-surgery, hypothesizing an MDSC expansion triggered by increases in myelopoiesis cytokines (IL-6, TGFB, and GM-CSF). MDSCs will be phenotyped as lineage negative CD11b+CD14-MHCII-. Readouts will include flow cytometry, multiplex ELISA, and RNA sequencing from multiple time points, including pre-surgery, post-surgery, and post-immunotherapy. Aim 2: Evaluate circulating NK and MDSC levels in relation to clinical outcomes.

This is largely driven by a lack of effective treatment options. The majority of PDA patients receive conventional chemotherapy, and while some initially respond to the standard of care therapies, most do not maintain a durable response or rapidly develop chemoresistance. This project aims to overcome resistance to gemcitabine, one of the most widely used cytotoxic agents in PDA therapy. Improvement of gemcitabine chemotherapy combinations represents an immediately translatable clinical benefit to PDA patients. To develop methods to overcome gemcitabine resistance, we have generated models of chemoresistance in syngeneic murine PDA lines and assembled a library of pancreatic cancer patient-derived organoids with an array of responses to gemcitabine. Through transcriptional profiling, we identified several mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming in our gemcitabine resistant models. Further characterization revealed several potential metabolic vulnerabilities, including the mevalonate pathway. We have generated preliminary data showing that approaches targeting the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, HMG-CoA reductase, are significantly more potent in gemcitabine resistant PDA cells than in the respective parental counterparts. Downstream rescue experiments have demonstrated that the main impact is through loss of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate levels, however, further investigation will be needed to provide additional mechanistic details. The research in this proposal will determine the potential of combining gemcitabine treatment with inhibition of the mevalonate pathway to treat chemoresistant PDA. We will use both immune-competent murine allografts and patient-derived organoids as preclinical models. In addition, we will examine the impact of other identified metabolic targets that can potentially be used to overcome the acquisition of gemcitabine resistance. Finally, we will test if the approaches to overcome gemcitabine chemoresistance are also effective against PDA cells that are resistant to other clinically deployed therapies.

Radiation therapy combined with surgery is the standard-of-care for sarcoma treatment; however, radiation causes severe, permanent damage to the surrounding tissues including depletion of the skeletal muscle stem cells required for maintenance and repair. Because sarcomas disproportionally affect young people (11% of all adolescent cancers), patients that survive radiation will experience muscle atrophy and reduced mobility over their lifetime. We have a strategy to generate skeletal muscle from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with the ability to build new muscles following transplantation. Since hPSCs can be readily obtained from patients from any genetic background and expanded indefinitely, we have an opportunity to provide a robust cell therapy to reconstruct tissues for sarcoma survivors. We hypothesize that transplanted hPSC derived skeletal muscle will prevent muscle atrophy and loss of muscle function after surgery and irradiation in Rhabdomyosarcomas. Aim 1. Generate a Rhabdomyosarcoma mouse model to evaluate the effects on muscle stem cell repair and function. We will perform allogenic transplant of bioluminescent-expressing human sarcoma cells into quadriceps of mice to induce tumor formation. Tumors will be subject to surgical removal and/or radiation therapy at multiple time points. We will evaluate endogenous muscle stem cell’s ability to regenerate functional muscle at treated tumor sites. Aim 2. Test transplantation of hPSC skeletal muscle to restore the stem cell pool and muscle function. It’s unclear whether the volumetric muscle loss following surgical tumor removal or irradiated tissue remnants, such as extracellular matrices, can support engraftment of muscle stem cells. We will perform cell transplantations at irradiated sites with or without hydrogel plugs to test cell replacement of functional skeletal muscles within the irradiated muscle environment.

Maternal obesity and high birth weight are repeatedly associated with various cancers in children and adults. The IGF axis has been highlighted as a plausible underlying mechanism given that i) IGF-1 and IGF-2 are present in fetal circulation and play key roles in fetal growth and development; ii) IGF-1 is strongly positively correlated with fetal growth and birth weight; and iii) the IGF axis is implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of different types of human cancer such as colon, breast, prostate, lung and leukemia. Early-life efforts for cancer prevention may therefore begin in utero through modulation of the fetal IGF axis, which is thought to be stimulated by circulating glucose and insulin. Maternal diet may be a key modifiable factor via its influence on glucose tolerance. We propose a prospective observational study of N=80 pregnant women with pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity and diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, leveraging the high proportion of Hispanic and Asian women who obtain prenatal care at the UCI medical center. Maternal diet in each trimester will be assessed using two 24-hour dietary recalls and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index for Pregnancy will be computed as a measure of diet quality. At 28 weeks’ gestation, maternal fasting glucose, insulin, and c-peptide will be measured and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance computed. Maternal glucose concentrations from the standard glucose challenge test will be abstracted from medical record. Neonatal IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 will be assayed from cord blood. The separate and combined contribution of maternal diet and glucose-insulin homeostasis to variation in concentrations of cord blood IGFs and IGFBPs will be analyzed, with trimester-specific analysis for the effects of maternal diet.

The standard of care for patients who relapse or have refractory (R/R) DLBCL >12 months after initial treatment is an autologous, or in some instances, an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). For patients who relapse <12 months after first-line therapy, HCT is still an option, with the addition of chimeric antigen T-cell therapy more recently becoming a standard of care treatment in this setting. Patients often receive second and further lines of chemo-immunotherapy for disease control for R/R DLBCL, but without HCT, all therapies are palliative in nature. The utilization of HCT in patients with DLBCL remains low for certain patients and can be impacted by multiple factors, such as access to a transplant center and insurance status. Prior studies have found racial/ethnic disparities in the utilization of autologous HCT in lymphoma patients, with Non-Hispanic Black patients undergoing HCT less often than their Non-Hispanic White counterparts and having inferior survival. To date, little is known about the influence of sociodemographic and clinical factors on HCT utilization for patients with lymphoma over time. In order to identify barriers to care in patients with DLBCL, we propose a retrospective cohort study of all DLBCL patients diagnosed in California from 1992 to 2016 using a novel data linkage from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), California Cancer Registry (CCR), and statewide hospitalization data. A study in multiple myeloma patients from this linkage has identified that each of the three data sources independently capture HCT utilization, permitting the assessment of utilization of HCT at the population-level. These data sources also include sociodemographic factors (race/ethnicity, health insurance status, neighborhood socioeconomic status, sex, and age at diagnosis) and clinical factors (e.g., chemo-immunotherapy, disease stage, and comorbidities).

This rewiring enhances cancer growth but can also generate vulnerabilities to therapeutic interventions. To enable cell proliferation, cancers frequently deregulate key transitions in the tightly-controlled cell division cycle. Prior work has focused on developing therapeutic agents that target uncontrolled entry into the DNA replication phase of the cell cycle in cancers (the G1-S transition). In this proposal, we will develop an unexpected observation that implicates BET (Bromodomain and ExtraTerminal domain) proteins in promoting entry into mitosis after completion of DNA replication (the G2-to-M transition). BET proteins harbor two domains that recognize acetylated lysine residues and are emerging targets for cancer therapy based on their involvement in numerous chromatin-related functions, including transcriptional regulation and protection from DNA damage. Employing a live imaging assay for quantitatively monitoring mitotic entry in single cells, we have observed a role for BET proteins in promoting the G2-to-M transition. BET inhibition delays mitotic entry in cancer-derived and non-transformed, immortalized cell lines. In a specific colorectal cancer-derived cell line, BET inhibition strongly synergizes with inhibition of the mitotic kinase PLK1 to block mitotic entry. The proposed work will investigate how BET proteins contribute to mitotic entry, testing specific hypotheses related to transcriptional regulation, DNA damage, and the mitotic entry circuit. The proposed effort represents an entirely new research area for the group, which has historically focused on chromosome segregation, centrosome function, spindle assembly, and checkpoint function during mitosis. Successful execution of the project has the potential to advance understanding of the cellular functions of BET proteins and of the control of mitotic entry in human cells, while also revealing whether there are opportunities for targeting the G2-M transition of the cell cycle, as has been done for the G1-S transition, in specific cancer contexts.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Arshad Desai,,,,"University of California, San Diego",https://ror.org/0168r3w48,ROR,https://ror.org/,2023-10-01,Issued,,C24CR7701,award-number,,,,,,

This phenomenon, often referred to as the Warburg Effect, was originally observed in tumor cells. The benefit of the Warburg Effect to a cell has been unclear, given that partial metabolism of glucose yields an order of magnitude less ATP per molecule of glucose than complete oxidation. In our recent theoretical study, we proposed that the Warburg Effect stems from the optimization of energy metabolism that allows cells to produce ATP at the highest rate in the presence of excess glucose independent of cell growth rate. By estimating the yield, specific activity, and proteome occupancy of the glycolysis and respiration pathways from published studies in bacteria, yeast, and mammals, we found that for each organism, the data is consistent with glycolysis producing ATP at a faster rate per gram of pathway protein than respiration. However, we could only find a limited number of published datasets for mammalian cells that contain measurements required for our calculations. Here, we propose to perform rigorous measurements of glycolysis and respiration pathway rates per gram of pathway protein in mammalian cancer cell lines to generate additional evidence to support or refute our hypothesis. Our lab has extensive experience performing metabolic flux and proteomics measurements in mammalian cells that will be required for this project, which will allow us to complete the proposed measurement within the 1-year duration of the Seed Grant.

Metastasis accounts for the majority of cancer related deaths and therapeutic strategies that can prevent or reduce metastatic burden are urgently needed. The lung is the most common site of metastasis in several cancers such as breast, lung, colon, melanoma, bladder, prostate and kidney. Recent studies have shown that cancer cells guide the creation of a pre-metastatic niche to exit cellular dormancy and proliferate to form metastatic lesions. Cancer cells achieve this by secretion of specific cytokines that promote an immune suppressive phenotype in the secondary organ. However, the role of the secondary organ in creating the metastatic niche is underappreciated. Moreover, it is unclear if and how previous injury through respiratory infections and pulmonary fibrosis can influence the growth of metastatic cancer cells in the lung. Among individuals hospitalized for severe respiratory viral infections, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, 25 - 50% of patients experience persistent respiratory symptoms due to chronic effects of lung tissue damage. Our research has demonstrated that these infections induce distinct fibroblast activation states that drive immunopathology during acute infection and promote pulmonary fibrosis following clearance of the infection. We have also developed a clinically relevant and well characterized influenza model in mice that allows us to study persistent inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis at chronic, post-viral stages of disease. Working in collaboration with the Sikandar lab at UC Santa Cruz, we have optimized this model to study breast cancer metastasis following viral infection. We are uniquely positioned to ask the following questions: 1. Does prior respiratory viral infection promote metastasis of breast tumor cells to the lung tissue? 2. Do inflammatory lung fibroblasts activated following severe viral infection promote metastatic niches for tumor cells?

Although classically druggable, no commercially available inhibitors of Gαs exist. Here, we propose an innovative approach to develop and characterize chemical inhibitors of Gαs. Given prior in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating that GNAS knockout is lethal to GNASR201 tumors, there is a high likelihood that chemical inhibition of Gαs will be an effective therapeutic strategy for GNASR201 mutant tumors. New Treatments are Needed for Appendiceal Cancer, Currently an Orphan Disease. Appendiceal tumors encompass a rare and diverse group of neoplasms; AA is the most common histologic subtype. Epidemiologic studies based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data have shown a steady increase in incidence from approximately 0.2 cases per 100,000 in the 1970s, to current estimates of just over 1 per 100,000. In comparison, this is 40-fold less common than colon cancer, which in the US has an incidence of approximately 40 per 100,000. Cases of early-onset AA, defined as diagnosis before age 50, have increased by 24% between 2011 to 2016, and in 2016 represented 40% of all appendiceal cancer. In contrast, the increase in early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC) was only 2.2% for that same time period. Historically, appendiceal tumors have been grouped together with CRCs, and as of 2021 the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines still suggested that appendiceal tumors be treated with chemotherapy similarly to colon tumors. The rarity of AA has made it difficult to conduct clinical trials, and in the absence of trial data, the NCCN guidelines assume biological similarity due to anatomic vicinity, common embryological origin, and common expression of the transcription factor CDX2. However, there is a growing consensus that AA is a clinically and molecularly distinct entity from CRC, and that AA specific therapies (none exist currently) need to be developed.

Drugs that target the innate immune protein STING elicit potent anti-cancer responses in mice, and >15 STING agonists entered clinical trials in the past 10 years. However, in 2023 the first trial results showed a lack of efficacy. The emerging challenges in the field are now to increase efficacy of innate immune agonists while maintaining tumor-specific T cell responses. We recently discovered that STING agonist efficacy is dramatically enhanced when used in combination with agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), another class of innate immune receptors. We found that a single combination dose can elicit complete responses in >80% of mice bearing established B16-F10 melanomas, as compared to 25% with monotherapy. Mice that cleared primary tumors developed resistance to tumor cell rechallenge. This demonstrates that the challenges of efficacy and T cell priming can be overcome through STING+TLR agonist combination therapy. However, key questions regarding the mechanisms of synergy are unanswered, including: what cytokines and cell types are required for the anti-tumor synergy elicited by STING+TLR agonists? Understanding this mechanism will aid future clinical studies on innate immune agonist therapies for cancer. We propose in Aim 1 to determine the role for immune cells in the anti-tumor response to combination therapy. We will use flow cytometry to measure T cell activation and the abundance of immune cell types including neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. To determine the requirement for these cells in the anti-tumor synergy, we will deplete CD8, CD4, and NK cells and measure tumor volume after therapy.

The c-Myc oncogene encodes a transcription factor and thus regulates many other genes. However, transcription factors are difficult targets for which to design drugs. As exemplified by c-Myc, genetic interactions are at the root of normal and malignant cell growth. Interactions between gene pairs have been cataloged in mammalian cells by combining knockouts created using CRISPR/Cas9 or siRNA and observing the changes in cell growth. However, these piecemeal approaches are laborious and expensive and do not address the >200 million genetic interactions that potentially occur. An approach that can affordably map the entire array of genetic interactions in normal and diseased cells is urgently needed. We have developed a technology using radiation hybrid (RH) cells that is capable of elucidating with high sensitivity and specificity genes that interact even though they are located at a distance within in the genome. Our approach yields high-resolution, comprehensive maps of interacting gene pairs. RH panels are constructed by lethally irradiating cells so that the DNA shatters. The fragments are then introduced into living cells so that a random assortment, ~25%, of genes are triploid rather than diploid. Statistically significant patterns of co-inherited triploid genes point to the cell's survival mechanism. Most importantly, the fragments are so small that the technique often provides single-gene resolution, revealing with specificity the multiple roles one gene plays within a cell. Our preliminary data shows that low pass genome sequencing of nascent human RH clones (RH-Seq) is an economical approach to constructing interaction maps. The network showed significant overlap with a previous network obtained by us that established the groundwork for the RH approach and showed that coinheritance of distant genes is an important mechanism for cell viability. Our goal is to map genetic interactions for the entire genome in normal cells and cells that overexpress c-Myc.

Therefore, the basal activation level of the immune system may determine the rate of successful metastases in individual patients and could be a viable therapeutic target to slow cancer progression. Our recent work has suggested that the gut microbiota is a potent source for immune stimulatory molecules and that an individual’s microbiota can correlate with their responsiveness to cancer immunotherapies. Thus, we hypothesize that the microbiota’s capacity to generate specific, immune active metabolites may more broadly affect cancer progression including the successful formation of new metastatic sites. This one-year, pilot project will focus on two aims. First, we will examine whether increasing the processing of bacterial cell wall in the gut can control the metastatic progression of melanoma. This will be accomplished using our previous model to orally supplement the gut microbiota with specific microbes or enzymes and will be applied to the established murine model of melanoma metastasis using intravenous injection of B16-F10 cells. Second, we will define host factors caused by increased enzymatic activity in the gut that may function as both biomarkers and causal agents for immune activity against circulating and newly colonizing tumor cells. Here, we will use targeted mass spectrometry to quantify muramic acid in murine blood samples after supplementation as a proxy readout for circulating cell wall fragments. We will also use flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify and characterize a population of bacterial cell wall-responsive CX3CR1+Ly6Clo patrolling monocytes as a cellular biomarker and a potential effector cell population for reduced metastasis. These studies align with our laboratory’s broader goals (1) to define the mechanisms of immune activation by the gut microbiota during cancer progression and treatment and (2) to develop enzyme- and probiotic-based methods to selectively augment host immune responses as single agents or in combination with other cancer therapies. If successful, this work will provide direct evidence that modulation of enzymatic capacity in the gut – that is, the overall ability to selectively produce metabolites – can alter immune-mediated protection against metastasis.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Matthew Griffin,,,,"University of California, Irvine",https://ror.org/04gyf1771,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-10-01,Issued,,C25CR8608,award-number,,,,,,

Yet, these alone are insufficient to predict an individual’s disease onset and risks, indicating that nongenetic events within the tumor ecosystem (‘niches’) play a role in unleashing tumorigenesis. Stem cells are the origin of many life-threatening malignancies and are notorious for their tight dependency on the surrounding microenvironment. Despite undisputed importance, our understanding of how the ecosystems that stem cells inhabit direct oncogenic fate flexibility is limited. Equally, it remains a mystery whether early-stage tumor initiation through advanced disease progression is supported by overlapping or distinct niches. These gaps in knowledge can largely be attributed to a dearth of tools and models that capture the oncogenic stem cell identity landscape in intact tissues. The lymphatic vascular network is an emerging, previously unrecognized niche entity for epithelial stem cells, yet much of the mystery of the lymphatic niches in directing tumorigenesis remains untapped. The goal of our proposed work is to determine how distinct vascular cues drive oncogenic flexibility and tumorigenesis in rare pre-cancer stem cells. Using deep imaging and sequencing approaches in skin squamous cell carcinoma, we discovered that lymphatic vascular insufficiency predisposes to malignant transformation. Detailed temporal volumetric imaging revealed that oncogenic plasticity propelling the transition from benign to metastatic carcinoma is preceded by dynamic lymphatic remodeling. These results raise the intriguing possibility that lymphatic niches evolve during disease progression, directing oncogenic tolerance in tumor-initiating cells while becoming a significant barrier to cancer treatments. To fill these knowledge gaps, we aim to determine how vascular circuits shape oncogenic tolerance in mutated yet untransformed cells in concert with their evolving niches, and to identify non-mutational drivers that build the pro-metastatic niche using our newly developed enhancer-based proximity sensor technology. Our innovative approach will define how vascular circuits shape the stem cell oncogenic landscape.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a powerful strategy for cancer treatment that offers new opportunities for patients with malignant gliomas. However, there are several barriers that possibly dampen the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy for glioma, including the intrinsic nonimmunogenic phenotype of glioma cells and their immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To solve this problem, we have established murine orthotopic GBM models for optimizing IL13Rα2 CAR-T cell therapeutic parameters for clinical translation through collaboration. The immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models of GBM, and murine-CAR-T cells more precisely recapitulate patient glioma tumors and will provide essential information regarding the effect of therapies on the TME. For effective CAR-T therapy against GBM, it has been shown that activation of endogenous T cells and anti-tumor TME is required. Protein Phosphatase 2A is heterotrimeric, consisting of scaffolding (A), regulatory (B), and catalytic (C) subunits that interact to form a functional holoenzyme. We were the first to demonstrate that inhibiting PP2A enhanced immunogenicity of glioma cells to induce sensitivity to tumor specific T cells mediated killing and reprogrammed the TME toward anti tumor. We demonstrated that LB-100, small molecule inhibitor of the conserved catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac), synergizes with PD1 blockade in multiple in vivo tumor models including GBM7,8. These results led to a phase I/II clinical trial testing LB100 in patients with recurrent GBM (NCT03027388) and a combination trial with anti-PD-1 in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (NCT06065462). Elucidating the role of PP2Ac within different cell types of the TME in regulating tumor sensitivity to CAR-T therapy is critical to inform rational combination in future clinical trials. We hypothesize that inhibition of PP2Ac will overcome the barriers for CAR-T cell therapy in glioma TME, and combination of IL13Rα2 CAR-T cell therapy and PP2A inhibitor will be a potential novel combination treatment for brain tumors. Successful completion of this project will provide preclinical insights to initiate novel clinical trials of combining PP2A inhibitor with IL13Rα2 CAR-T therapy.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Rongze Olivia Lu,,,,"University of California, San Francisco",https://ror.org/043mz5j54,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-10-01,Issued,,C25CR8620,award-number,,,,,,

Unfortunately, patients who develop metastatic BC (mBC) have a poor 5-year survival of ~15%. Recently, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting the surface protein NECTIN4 (enfortumab vedotin, EV) was approved, validating NECTIN4 as an important target in mBC. Although EV monotherapy has a response rate of 44%, resistance invariably develops to the ADC. Interestingly, our preliminary and unpublished data demonstrates that NECTIN4 expression is retained on the surface of EV-resistant cells (that we generated in the lab) as well as in patient biopsy samples post-EV resistance (measured by immunohistochemistry). Therefore, we hypothesize that additional strategies to target NECTIN4 using CAR T and radioimmunotherapies (RIT) are rapidly needed, and will be efficacious both in EV-naïve and EV-resistant settings. However, to date, neither of these therapeutic modalities have been approved for bladder cancer patients. In this proposal, we will develop these two approaches and perform rigorous preclinical evaluation using 3 in vivo model systems: 1) an orthotopic bladder tumor model; 2) a subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model; and 3) a lung metastasis model. Our study will also use unique PDX’s developed at UCSF from minority patients (an important understudied population) and models of EV resistance that we created in our lab. If our results are positive, we plan to translate our findings into an investigator-initiated clinical trial, and will have two non-overlapping opportunities to do so – one with the CAR T and the other with the RIT. As a translational genitourinary medical oncologist and lab-based investigator, I have extensive experience leading pre-clinical studies of novel agents in the lab and running investigated-initiated clinical trials at UCSF. I am also fortunate to work with a fantastic team, so that we can translate findings from the bench to the bedside and back again.

The preliminary discovery was serendipitous but the PI is trying to acquire funding to pursue this important finding. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a promising targeted treatment for cancer. However, current PDT is limited by low tissue penetration, insufficient phototoxicity (toxicity with light irradiation), and undesirable cytotoxicity (toxicity without light irradiation). Recently, Sophia and Richard Lunt introduced a novel platform for tuning the toxicity of near-infrared (NIR) light activated photosensitizers (PSs) through counterion pairing in organic salts, achieving greater tissue penetration, improved phototoxicity, and minimal cytotoxicity. It turns out that using this approach, but with special molecules called carborane anions developed in Lavallo's lab, unprecedented higher potency and efficacy against primary breast tumors as well as metastatic breast cancer cells has been observed. Sophia Lunt has characterized their cellular uptake, organelle localization, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), suppression of pro-metastatic pathways, and activation of apoptotic pathways using metastatic breast cancer cell lines. Further she has shown that Lavallo's molecules have the ability to create PSs that stop tumor growth in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer to an unprecedented level. The newly developed lead PS formulation introduces a potent therapeutic approach against aggressive breast cancer cells while decreasing side effects in healthy cells. This seed grant funding will be used by Lavallo's group to create libraries of commercially unavailable carborane salts and provide them to the Lunt groups for elaboration and exploration of structure activity/toxicity relationships of the therapeutics.

Pathogenesis is driven by high rates of viral hepatitis, untreated cirrhosis, and limited access to HCC screening and treatment. Globally, 2.5% of patients with cirrhosis will develop HCC each year. With adequate resources around 40% of diagnosed HCC patients will receive curative surgical resection, local ablation, or transplant, however in SSA less than 1% of patients receive such treatment. In Tanzania, there is a national effort to improve early diagnosis and treatment of HCC. Despite this, the multidisciplinary liver tumor board (MDTB) at the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) notes that treatment rates for localized HCC are less than 25% of expected. Access to treatment and resources are limited outside of the largest hospitals and care recommendations vary by location, resulting in delayed, disjointed, and uncoordinated care. The landscape for HCC care in Tanzania is unknown. We hypothesize that lack of established referral pathways and treatment guidelines contribute to deficient treatment rates. To address the current absence of HCC data and facilitate treatment, we aim to perform the following: 1) Perform a national assessment of HCC diagnostic and treatment resources, including screening infrastructure, surgical and locoregional capacity, systemic treatment availability, and access to supportive care, 2) Implement a national virtual liver cancer tumor board to strengthen multidisciplinary care and coordination, and 3) Develop contextualized and resource-specific treatment guidelines for liver cancer in Tanzania with assessment of impact using a retrospective patient cohort.

While T cell therapies have brought about a transformative impact on cancer treatment, their effectiveness is limited to a few cancer types, and has struggled to be applicable to individuals with diverse immunogenetic profiles. There is an urgent need to shift our focus towards automated target discovery, with the aim of reaching a broader patient population. The overall goal of this project is to propel the discovery of targets for novel T-cell therapies and expand their use in patients with diverse immunogenetic backgrounds by deploying AI-driven tools to analyze high throughput RNA sequencing data. My lab has recently developed an AI-driven framework and two pivotal datasets, containing 2 million publicly available single T cell transcriptomes, with matching T cell receptor data, and experimentally validated T cell antigen specificity data, extracted from 265 cancer patients, across 30 cancer types. This framework aims to accelerate the discovery of novel T cell therapies for cancer, promising faster and more cost effective development, with broader accessibility to diverse patient populations. Notably, ours is the only known methodology capable of automating the design of T cell therapies using data from an individual's adaptive immune system, without knowledge of their cancer genome. We harnessed our AI-driven framework and database to discover a novel T cell therapy that can target two key cancer antigens: insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2), prevalent in multiple cancer types, and associated with poorer patient survival, and well known target, melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells 1, (MART1).

This process of malignant transformation endows some cells with extraordinary properties to avoid surveillance mechanisms, skip cell death, and proliferate indefinitely. Most cases of cellular transformation occur as tissues replace old and damaged cells with new ones. However, tissue renewal is challenging to analyze as it tends to happen simultaneously in many tissues that turnover at different rates for many years. In humans, for example, cellular turnover is continuous throughout the lifespan, deploying billions of cells daily to renew tissues such as blood, epidermis, and gastrointestinal epithelia. A significant limitation in the field is the lack of experimental models to analyze systemic tissue renewal and malignant transformation simultaneously. A predominant view explaining the progression of malignancy claims that the deregulation of tumor suppressors induces DNA damage that is present at the early stages in almost all cancers. We propose a paradigm shift by introducing a simplified experimental model to enable in situ analyses of cellular transformation during tissue renewal. The planarian flatworm continuously renews about 40 tissue types throughout the body, and we developed the first planarian cancer model by inhibiting PTEN, the second most inactivated gene in human cancers. PTEN-mediated cancer in planarians aggressively elicits a phenotype that resembles mammalian carcinogenesis. It takes less than two weeks to observe neoblast over-proliferation, tissue invasion, and the formation of lethal tumors. However, how malignancy arises and evolves during tissue renewal in planarians is unknown. We aim to leverage the integration of systemic tissue turnover and PTEN function to address the earliest manifestations of malignancy and identify the cells driving the cancer phenotype. Preliminary results demonstrate that DNA damage underlies cellular transformation that is detectable after a few hours of PTEN inhibition. The results also suggest that disrupting neural transcription factors essential for neurogenesis can prevent malignancy.

Recent evidence has suggested that the growth and treatment refractoriness of GBM derives in large part from the dynamic interplay between tumor cells and supportive cells in the tumor microenvironment. Along those lines, my lab has intriguing data using single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify cells in GBM that express canonical cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) markers, have CAF morphology, and transcriptomically resemble CAFs from other cancers rather than other stromal cells with similar surface markers such as pericytes. These findings challenge conventional thinking because, while the existence of CAFs in many systemic cancers and their pro-tumoral effects were demonstrated over two decades ago, CAFs had been assumed to be absent in GBM given the lack of normal fibroblasts in the healthy brain. Using spatial transcriptomics, we also demonstrated that these CAFs are enriched in the perivascular niche (PVN) of GBM close to GBM stem cells (GSCs), where they increase GSC proliferation. GBM CAFs also promote pro-tumoral effects on macrophages in GBM. Here, we will build on this intriguing data by investigating our central hypothesis that the GBM PVN is a unique regional microenvironment in which GSCs recruit circulating marrow-derived progenitors that differentiate into CAFs that alter GSCs and their microenvironment in a pro-tumoral manner that promotes therapeutic resistance. We will investigate this hypothesis through three aims: Aim 1 – Determine the origin of CAFs in GBM and the mechanism of their recruitment to the GBM perivascular niche; Aim 2 - Define the immunosuppressive effects of CAFs on T-cells in the GBM microenvironment and the mechanisms of these effects; and Aim 3 - Characterize the role of CAFs in GBM resistance to standard cytotoxic therapies.

This proposed research is the first to consider how MMC influences progression in pancreatic ducal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC patients have a 5-year survival rate below 5%. While the PDAC is primarily driven by genetic mutations in KRAS and tumor suppressor genes, PDAC metastasis lacks recurrent genetic drivers. This suggests that non-genetic factors play a critical role in shaping the disease’s progression. Research shows a relationship between MMC and progress in other cancers. We propose investigating how nucleoplasmic MMC influences PDAC progression and metastasis using innovative tools like nucleoplasmic genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles and 3D PDAC organoid models. Our observations hint at perturbed nucleoplasmic MMC in metastatic PDAC organoids, suggesting a potential role in PDAC metastasis. Furthermore, analysis of existing PDAC organoid RNA-seq datasets has unveiled the up-regulation of nesprin-3, a crucial component of the outer nuclear membrane and the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, in metastatic PDAC organoids. LINC complexes govern cytoplasmic MMC, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport, mechanotransduction, and chromatin organization. Our proposed experiments will determine whether nesprin-3 regulates nucleoplasmic MMC, offering a promising avenue for targeted therapy against PDAC metastasis.

Entry into the cell cycle occurs only when sufficient growth has occurred and only when there are sufficient nutrients for further growth. In animal cells, cell cycle entry is controlled by growth factors, which ensures that cell division occurs at an appropriate time and place. Defects in the signals that control cell cycle entry are a primary cause of cancer. The mechanisms that initiate cell cycle entry are poorly understood. The critical molecular event that drives cell cycle entry is expression of late G1 phase cyclins. Decades of work in both yeast and mammals led to a canonical model in which initiation of cell cycle entry occurs entirely via activation of late G1 phase cyclin transcription. In this model, a cyclin expressed in early G1 phase activates a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk), which then phosphorylates and inactivates a repressor protein that inhibits transcription of late G1 phase cyclins. In mammalian cells the repressor is the tumor suppressor Rb. In yeast, the repressor is Whi5. This model has been highly influential and has guided the field for decades, despite the existence of numerous observations that are difficult to reconcile with the model. Moreover, recent tests of the model in both yeast and mammalian cells have shown that the model is inadequate and inaccurate.

MYCN amplification via ecDNA has been linked to the presence of replication stress (RS), and RS is associated with defects in DNA replication and repair and is an important driver of tumor initiation and progression via induction of chromosomal instability. However, the role of RS and its significance as a potential therapeutic target in NB are unknown. We have established that MYCN-amplified NB cells demonstrate significantly increased sensitivity to inhibition of targets that generate increased RS compared to NB cells without MYCN amplification. We hypothesize that enhanced sensitivity of MYCN-amplified NB cells to induction of RS is due to a lethal increase in levels in RS beyond that induced by ecDNA formation and maintenance. Therefore, we propose to evaluate NB cells and tumors for the mechanisms of vulnerability to RS induction. We will investigate the contributions of MYCN amplification and expression and of ecDNA prevalence and content to sensitivity to RS induction in NB and evaluate the roles of MYCN- and ecDNA-induced RS in NB cell and tumor growth and response to treatment. Our proposed research will identify and validate novel approaches for targeting MYCN in NB via the unique strategy of targeting RS in a cancer cell-specific fashion. The proposed research will also facilitate future clinical trials and commercialization of novel inhibitors capable of inducing RS for treating MYCN-amplified NB tumors in need of less toxic and more effective therapies.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Peter Zage,,,,"University of California, San Diego",https://ror.org/0168r3w48,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-10-01,Issued,,C25CR8662,award-number,,,,,,

SF3B1 is a core component of the spliceosome and an essential protein in the RNA splicing process. Mutations in SF3B1 are a common cause of RNA dysregulation in multiple carcinomas and myeloid malignancies, and targeting the spliceosome has been evaluated in preclinical models and clinical trials. On the other hand, aberrant expressions, not mutations, of SF3B1 are common in cancers, including sarcomas and lymphoid malignancies, suggesting the role of RNA splicing can be different in different cancers. Recently a study on aberrant RNA splicing and its potential as a therapeutic target in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was published. Aberrant RNA splicing has also been reported in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL); however, its role and therapeutic potential are not yet known. Our preliminary studies in B-ALL suggest that leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) that we discovered use unique RNA splicing as a survival mechanism and are sensitive to SF3B1 targeting. Therefore, targeting leukemia cells, including LICs, has the potential to eradicate leukemia at its root. LICs are believed to be the reason for disease relapse, and relapsed diseases still have very poor outcomes. Our project has the potential to overcome the significant challenges of treating relapsed diseases. We hypothesize that SF3B1 selectively regulates apoptosis-associated genes, and inhibition of SF3B1 induces cell death in B-ALL cells. We will investigate the role of SF3B1 in B-ALL cell survival, particularly in LICs. We will investigate the therapeutic potential of SF3B1 inhibition, with or without another drugs, both in vitro and in vivo, using our well-established, patient-derived high-risk B-ALL xenograft models. Understanding the role of RNA splicing in leukemia cell apoptosis in this project has the potential to lead to novel therapeutics to improve overall outcomes by decreasing treatment failure and relapse and has the potential to minimize negative side effects of current treatments by directing the therapy to LICs.

Within sarcomas, few therapeutic targets have been identified and those tested in clinical trials demonstrate limited efficacy. As a result, people with sarcoma have a 65% five-year survival rate despite aggressive multimodality treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Increasing our understanding of sarcoma biology, discovering new therapeutic vulnerabilities, and identifying opportunities for targeted therapies will improve patient outcomes. We have developed a robust pre-clinical model that allows for the study of sarcoma development, growth, and metastasis across complex karyotype subtypes. Using this system, we identified oncogenic drivers of sarcoma development including Yes-associated protein (YAP). YAP amplification is observed across human sarcomas and was also observed in our pre-clinical model. YAP is a transcriptional regulator of the Hippo pathway that, in conjunction with coactivators controls development, differentiation, and cancer in context and cell specific manners. During the development of YAP driven tumors, we observed increased activity of Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2). This protein is a key component of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) that methylates histones at H3K27 and recruits methyltransferases resulting in a closed chromatin state. We hypothesize that EZH2 is required for the development and progression of YAP driven sarcomas. In this study, we will define the interaction between YAP and EZH2 during transformation and determine if therapeutic targeting of YAP and EZH2 is a feasible clinical strategy. The era of targeted treatments and immunotherapy ushered in significant improvements in overall survival for patients with cancer. Despite this, the prognosis of high-grade complex karyotype sarcomas has remained stagnant. Inhibitors of YAP and Hippo signaling are under development and in clinical trials. Tazemetostat, an inhibitor of EZH2 is FDA approved for epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma. This study will be the first to investigate the role of YAP and EZH2 in complex karyotype sarcomas and validate these as therapeutic targets.

Overproduction or underproduction of histone protein can result in replication stress and genome instability that contribute to the development of cancer. The supply of histone proteins is primarily regulated at the level of replication-dependent (RD) histone mRNA production, a process that is tightly coupled to the phase of the cell cycle but remains incompletely understood. Here, we propose to investigate the mechanism of RD histone mRNA transcriptional termination, an enigmatic aspect of histone biogenesis with particular relevance to cancer formation. RD histone mRNAs are the only eukaryotic mRNAs in animal cells that lack poly(A) tails, ending instead with a conserved stem-loop structure. The genes encoding all five RD histone proteins are clustered in metazoan genomes, and transcription and pre-mRNA processing factors required for histone mRNA biosynthesis are organized into a nuclear body (the histone locus body or HLB) that assembles at these gene clusters. Because of their close proximity to one another, transcription of each RD histone mRNA copy has to terminate shortly after the stem-loop; delayed termination akin to that seen with most polyadenylated mRNAs can lead to aberrant replication stress, aberrant gene transcription, and chromosomal instability, which are signature hallmarks of cancer. In our preliminary studies, we found that acute depletion of RNase MRP - a ubiquitous and essential endonuclease known largely for its critical role in maturation of rRNAs – specifically affects termination of RD histone mRNA transcription. Here, we propose to investigate the requirement for the endonuclease activity of RNase MRP in RD histone mRNA termination and delineate the direct and indirect mechanisms by which compromised activity of RNase MRP could lead to deregulated production of histones and cancer development.

LRF has been observed in about 45% of ablative radiotherapy recipients in the recent PACIFIC trial. These indicate that remission rate may be reduced by either local boosting in the definitive radiotherapy or focal salvage treatment. These failure patterns also allude to the criticality in ensuring that the ablative dose has been actually delivered to the intended treatment volume, a question to be answered with sophisticated monitoring that is currently absent. In this project, we propose to work with the widely accessible x-ray based on-board imaging (OBI) system. As X-ray collapses attenuation information along the beam direction, there is depth uncertainty and compromised conspicuity of the tumor target. Furthermore, the OBI is configured at a fixed angle to the treatment megavoltage beam, so its view angle is passively determined by the treatment trajectory, and typically does not offer the best visibility for tumor target or surrounding tissue context. The suboptimal region-of-interest (ROI) visibility is further compounded with the obstruction of high attenuating structures such as the rib(cage) along the x-ray beamline, drowning important lung texture. To facilitate both online monitoring of the thorax anatomy, and spatiotemporal dose integration as quantitative evidence for adaptive SBRT, we will tailor neural field learning development with x-ray physics and geometry to (1) develop a physics and geometry informed view toggler to translate an online acquired OBI x-ray image to a clinically favorable angle with high GTV and context conspicuity (2) develop a virtual rib removing network to reveal the lung texture, and (3) Expand view toggler to full volumetric synthesizer to generate spatiotemporal anatomy for radiation dose accumulation. Success of this project will fill in the knowledge and clinical gap in fully monitoring the thorax dynamics during lung radiotherapy treatment, which has hindered the development and utilization of real-time adaptive control.

Yet, despite it’s profound importance, there are no clinical agents that directly target and inhibit Myc. Efforts to develop small molecule Myc inhibitors have been hindered by a lack of suitable binding pockets on the protein. Hence, Myc, like other transcription factors, has been considered “undruggable”. We propose to take an entirely different approach to develop a Myc inhibitor. Our approach will be based on the mechanism of Myc action and our prior success in developing a novel inhibitor of the “undruggable” transcription factor STAT3. Myc exerts it’s effects by first heterodimerizing with Max. Myc/Max then recognizes a unique, consensus DNA response element found in the promoter regions of Myc target genes. Following binding to these response elements, Myc/Max induces the transcription of target genes that promote oncogenesis and resistance to chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy. STAT3 oncoprotein similarly recognizes it’s own unique DNA response element. We previously generated a potent, selective, and well-tolerated STAT3 inhibitor that mimics the STAT3 DNA response element, and is called cyclic STAT3 decoy (CS3D). CS3D is a 15-bp double-stranded DNA molecule that is cyclized at both ends with hexaethylene glycolyl linkers. CS3D binds STAT3 and competitively inhibits STAT3 binding to the promoter region of target genes, shutting down expression of these genes. CS3D inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells and the growth of xenograft tumors following systemic delivery. We hypothesize that cyclic oligonucleotide decoys can be developed to target and inhibit Myc/Max. Three Aims are proposed. In Aim 1 we will generate and optimize cyclic oligonucleotide decoys targeting Myc/Max and the functional capacity of the cyclic decoys to bind Myc/Max will be determined. The optimal length and the specificity of each cyclic decoy will also be determined. Aim 2 will determine the ability of an optimized Myc/Max cyclic decoy to inhibit Myc-mediated transcription using Myc/Max reporter constructs and a scrambled sequence version of the cyclic decoy as a control.

Enhancers are genomic elements that control the timing, location, and levels of expression of a particular gene or genes, as such, enhancers provide the instructions for gene expression. While there has been extensive focus on protein-coding variants and genomic changes that alter protein-coding regions, how enhancer variants contribute to cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to therapy is poorly studied. Enhancers harbor the majority of variants associated with diseases including cancers, but pinpointing causal variants is a major challenge because they are typically embedded within a sea of inert variants. This gap in our knowledge is stalling efforts to harness the full potential of genomic data to understand and treat cancer. A clear understanding of which enhancer variants contribute to various aspects of cancer is vital to understand the genetic basis of cancer initiation, progression, to develop novel therapeutics, improve diagnosis, and stratify patients for more targeted treatments. In this study, we will pilot a novel approach to identify enhancer variants that contribute to changes in gene expression in melanoma. We are experts in identifying causal variants within enhancers that alter gene expression and cellular identity within the context of the developing embryo. We have found that low-affinity binding sites are critical for precise control of gene expression. The prevalent use of low affinity sites within enhancers creates a vulnerability within genomes whereby SNVs can increase the affinity of binding sites within enhancers causing gain of function gene expression that alters cellular identity. We have demonstrated this in the context of heart and limb development. We now wish to apply this knowledge to gain insight into causal variants that contribute to various aspects of cancer. We plan to initially focus on metastasis, immunotherapy response and drug resistance in melanoma.

In the past the sex difference in melanoma has always been attributed to differential sex-associated UV behaviors. Our epidemiological studies have recently revealed that the female sex itself is an independent risk factor for melanoma at younger age as compared to male sex. A bimodal mechanism of melanomagenesis is proposed to explain the sex- and age-differentiated melanoma risk: melanoma diagnosed at older age is mainly attributed to solar UV exposure with sex as a modification factor; while sex independently and directly contributes to early onset melanoma in addition to UV exposure. Our laboratory study suggested that testosterone enhanced DNA damage induced by solar-simulated radiation in normal human melanocytes, and estrogen induced differential ROS accumulation in melanocytes of different genders. Our pilot case-control study suggested that salivary testosterone and estrogen levels exhibited an age- and sex-differentiated association with melanoma. Hypothesis: estrogen and testosterone play crucial roles in early onset melanoma in women and men, respectively: estrogen promotes melanomagenesis via ROS in young women and testosterone protects young men via enhancing UV-induced DNA damage repair. Sex hormones play less roles and UV play more important role in late onset melanoma. In collaboration with clinicians and an experienced epidemiologist, we propose two specific aims: Aim 1: validate the age- and gender-specific associations of estrogen and testosterone levels with melanoma risk using a case-control study design. Aim 2: investigate the molecular mechanism of estrogen and testosterone in DNA damage repair in vitro in NHMs, and compare gender differences in a set of NHMs. This study is significant and novel as it is based on a new melanoma model, new discovery of salivary sex hormone association with melanoma and new role of testosterone in DNA damage in melanocytes.

To chronically colonize, H. pylori must gain nutrients and avoid the immune response. Our preliminary work suggests H. pylori may do both by taking up lactate. H. pylori uses lactate as both a carbon/energy source, and our preliminary data suggests it promotes H. pylori’s resistance to the innate immune molecule complement. We became interested in lactate because it’s one of a handful of molecules that H. pylori seeks out using chemotaxis. In unpublished work, our lab and others also found that lactate is one of the most preferred carbon sources for H. pylori. Interestingly, lactate is produced to high amounts by cancer cells. They redirect their metabolism from aerobic respiration to aerobic glycolysis, the so-called Warburg effect. This metabolism results in the formation and excretion of high amounts of lactate. Indeed, studies have shown that gastric cancer resulted in elevated stomach lactate, as compared to normal stomachs. Altogether, these results suggest a model whereby H. pylori benefits at least in part from gastric carcinogenesis because of the elevated lactate. There are significant gaps in our understanding of how H. pylori metabolizes lactate. Our HYPOTHESIS is that H. pylori actively seeks, metabolizes, and uses lactate for both growth and for complement-based immune evasion. IN AIM 1, we will identify the H. pylori proteins required for lactate uptake and metabolism using genetic knockouts and phenotypic characterization. We will test these mutants in mouse and complement resistance models, to gain insight into the role of lactate utilization in these processes. In AIM 2, we will characterize whether H. pylori infection leads to an increase in lactate production in gastric cell and intact stomach models, and furthermore, whether lactate creation or utilization genes are correlated with cancerous outcomes. Upon completion of this work, we will have a strong understanding of the pathways of H. pylori lactate uptake, and how it is metabolized for both growth and complement resistance.

One big obstacle in the field is the difficulty of building relevant bladder cancer mouse models, since the bladder urothelial cells are extremely resistant to transformation by just one or two oncogenes and no good bladder-specific Cre line is available. TCGA analyses of muscle invasive bladder cancer have revealed the top recurrent mutated genes, and inactivating mutations in three epigenetic regulators KMT2D, KDM6A, and ARID1A are very common. Based on this finding and previous in vitro studies in the field, we hypothesize that these three epigenetic regulators are essential for preventing bladder cancer progression. To test it, we have developed a novel method of delivering DNA plasmids into the mouse urothelium through electroporation, and built a baseline p53 Pten mouse bladder cancer model by delivering the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids targeting those two genes. Our preliminary histology and sequencing data showed that this approach can reliably generate bladder tumors with advanced-stage carcinoma in situ, and that the resulting tumors can be clonally derived from individual mutant cells. We will therefore build gRNA plasmids targeting various combinations of the three chromatin-remodeling genes, and co-deliver them with the p53 Pten plasmid. We will perform histological analyses of the bladder tumors for different groups of mice at early and later time points, and determine whether further mutating any combinations of Kmt2d, Kdm6a, and Arid1a genes will promote bladder cancer progression.

In addition, CO appears to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy. We have recently shown that that small doses of CO from designed CO-releasing molecules (photoCORMs) can be conveniently used to induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells cells in a dose-dependent manner through controlled CO release. We now plan to determine whether such co-administration of exogenous CO increases the efficacy of chemotoxic drugs in the treatment of solid cancers (consequently minimizing treatment-related adverse events). We will utilize in-vitro and in-vivo models of breast and ovarian cancer for our investigation towards assessing the effects of exogenous CO applications. (1) We will determine the optimal concentrations of photoCORMs in diminishing cell proliferation of breast and ovarian cancer cells in-vitro and in xenograft models, in the presence of various doses of commonly used chemotoxic drugs, and (2) We will investigate the detailed mechanism(s) of CO-mediated inhibition of antioxidant pathways in breast and ovarian cancer cells in-vitro and in xenograft models. In both aims, use of photoCORMs will allow delivery of precise doses of CO and study its effects under very controlled conditions. In a recent paper [1], we have shown that CO delivery from our photoCORMs selectively inhibits cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS, a heme protein) and attenuates the antioxidant capacity of human breast cancer cells. In cancer, CBS plays a significant role in drug resistance; silencing CBS expression could sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutics. Our results also demonstrated that exogenous CO delivery significantly increased the chemosensitivity of human breast cancer cells toward both Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel.

Two PFAS chemicals were recently classified as carcinogenic to humans, with the strongest associations being with kidney and testicular cancers. High levels of PFAS have been measured in the blood of firefighters and studies suggest that firefighters have a higher cancer risk compared to the general population. PFAS may possibly enter firefighters’ bodies through combustion of treated consumer products, contact with turnout gear, aqueous film-forming foam, and air and dust at fire stations. The Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA) and UC Irvine have partnered on this proposal to improve our understanding of PFAS exposures among OCFA firefighters. We previously collaborated on research related to COVID-19. This proposal reflects the cancer concerns of OC firefighters and the expertise of UC Irvine researchers. OCFA and UC Irvine are working together to measure PFAS levels in OCFA firefighters’ blood, determine PFAS exposure from combustion among live fire training instructors, and assess indoor PFAS exposures in fire stations and fire trucks. We will measure PFAS in firefighters' blood in coordination with the OCFA annual required tuberculosis testing of ~1000 firefighters. Results will be reported back to firefighters with an educational plan to minimize PFAS exposure, reduce cancer risk, and evaluate their exposure and cancer risks relative to other firefighters, OC residents, and general U.S. population. Firefighters with high PFAS blood levels will be invited to participate in an intervention to reduce PFAS levels by donating blood. To assess combustion sources of PFAS exposure, we will closely monitor firefighters in the OCFA burn cadre, a high-exposure group within the fire service, using silicone wristbands and repeat blood measures over time. Lastly, we will collect and analyze air and dust in fire stations and fire trucks to determine if firefighters are potentially exposed from these indoor environment.

Our project aims to identify early cancer blood biomarkers, called the Firefighter Early Biomarker (FEB) panel, which uses a blood test to detect early signs of cancer caused by these exposures. Collaborative Elements: This research involves a close partnership between wildfire health researchers at UC Davis, the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD), and the broader California fire service community. By working together, we aim to create practical solutions that can be quickly adopted to protect firefighters' health. Research Questions and Central Hypotheses: We aim to answer whether repeated exposure to fire-related chemicals leads to detectable changes in firefighters' blood that indicate an increased risk of cancer. We hypothesize that certain changes to DNA, called DNA methylation, can serve as early warning signs of cancer, and these changes can be measured and monitored over time. General Methodology: Our study will collect blood samples from firefighters before and after they participate in training exercises. We will analyze these samples to identify specific DNA methylation changes linked to exposure to harmful chemicals. We will also compare the effects of different exposure levels by analyzing samples from new recruits and experienced instructors who face different frequencies of exposure. Innovative Elements and Potential Impact: This project is innovative because it uses advanced genomic technologies to develop a blood test that can detect early cancer signs specific to firefighters' unique exposures. By identifying these early markers, we can implement timely interventions to reduce exposure and ultimately lower the risk of cancer. The potential impact is significant, as this approach could lead to policy changes within fire departments and improve the long-term health and safety of firefighters across California and beyond. Our community-based approach ensures that the research is grounded in the real-world experiences and needs of firefighters.

These hazards embody key characteristics of carcinogens by inducing epigenetic alterations and oxidative stress. The impact of personal protections and administrative/engineering controls on mitigating the cancer impact of these hazards has not previously been directly assessed. This study seeks to provide new knowledge by establishing a study that will follow a group of 647 California firefighters for 12 months. Firefighters will be asked to participate in repeated blood sample collections, body composition analysis, diet assessments, questionnaires about diverse topics (such as job classification and duties, workplace environment and practices, and physical, mental, and social health), clinical tests, and continuous monitoring of physical activity, heart rate, and sleep. Cancer risk and protective factors will be examined together with key cancer biomarkers that can gauge the importance of each individual and combination of factors on cancer risk. Selected biomarkers represent two hallmarks of cancer, epigenetic reprogramming and tumor-promoting inflammation. The central hypothesis is that cancer in firefighters is the result of the combined impact of a multitude of occupational-related hazards, many of which are modifiable targets for cancer prevention. Rigorous epidemiological studies such as this one are required to determine the directional association between these hazards and cancer risk in order to develop the most effective, accepted, and sustainable interventions. This study will be informed by collaborative, bi-directional input from fire service stakeholders through a community-based participatory research model and has the potential to prompt numerous actions to protect firefighters from cancer.

We will observe firefighters’ working practices and further conduct interviews and surveys to understand the social dynamics shaping firefighters’ perceptions and practices related to carcinogenic exposures. We will undertake a new organizational initiative to provide multi-cancer early detection tests, develop a series of educational programs, and improve organizational policies on cancer prevention. We will further examine their effectiveness in changing firefighters’ perceptions and behaviors and reducing cancer risks.

Cancer within the Fire Service is a leading cause for firefighter deaths both during active careers and after retirement likely from the accumulated carcinogen exposure and the relatively long time that tumors can develop before being detected. Cancer is the result of accumulated cellular damage that changes a cell from a normal state to a cancerous state with uncontrolled growth. Many carcinogens damage DNA leading to these changes. By looking at the DNA isolated from the cells within tumors, we can see the changes made to the DNA by these carcinogens. The changes made are not random, so each carcinogen leaves a tell-tale signature on the DNA. By analyzing these signatures, this project aims to identify which carcinogens of the many firefighters are exposed to over their career are most likely to cause the cancer DNA causing damage. Focusing on tumors arising in firefighters will enrich for these signatures making them more recognizable than within tumors collected from the general population. Knowing specifically which carcinogens, of the many, are most likely to have damaged the DNA leading to these tumors will enable better practices for limiting exposure through training and changes to protocols and protective gear.

During training , firefighters are exposed to toxic gases and particulate matter found in the smoke that fires generate. These airborne chemicals are known to cause cancer and put our firefighters at risk. Through this proposal, we will modify training exercises to reduce exposure to these cancer causing pollution, making trainings safer for firefighters across California. COLLABORATIVE ELEMENTS To investigate exposures firefighters face, scientists from UC Davis have already been collaborating with the LA County Fire Department, having developed tools firefighters use to collect air samples while they fight fires. In this work, UC Davis and LA County Fire Department will deploy these tools during live fire training events, and collect biospecimens. We will identify live fire training exercises that caused exposure in firefighters, then change these activities to reduce exposures. Then, LA County firefighters will educate other firefighters across California on how to make training safer. CENTRAL RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS By deploying tools developed by UC Davis, we hypothesize that through educating live fire instructors across California, we can teach firefighters statewide about methods proven to protect themselves from fire-induced airborne carcinogens, and that new recruits will continue to practice these methods throughout their careers. METHODOLOGY The LA County Fire Department will collect air samples during live fire trainings, and collect samples of their exhaled breath, urine, and a swab of their skin. These samples will be examined by UC Davis scientists for evidence of exposure to cancer causing compounds and particulate matter. Working together, we will determine whether new ways of training firefighters reduce their exposure to these compounds while still meeting the objective of the training activity, producing healthy and well-trained firefighters in California.

PrEP, if used as directed, could virtually eliminate the risk of HIV acquisition among high risk populations. In addition to the brick and mortar sites, the state of California provides PrEP delivered through telemedicine (telePrEP) at no cost for those enrolled in their PrEP Assistance Program (PrEP-AP). Program participants enroll by visiting a local enrollment site once and then follow up visits, testing, and prescription filling occur remotely without visiting a clinic. However, this option is underutilized, with only a small number of people using telemedicine to get PrEP. The goal of this implementation science proposal is to develop an intervention which increases uptake of California’s telePrEP program (referred to as “Cal telePrEP” for this proposal). The study will occur in two phases. First, we will work with community based organizations, health policy stakeholders, industry stakeholders and prospective patients to identify barriers and facilitators to the uptake of telePrEP among Latinx MSM and transwomen. Data on barriers and facilitators will be collected through qualitative data collection methods (focus groups and in-depth interviews), and the development of interview/focus group guides, as well as the analysis of subsequent data, will be guided by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework. We will then analyze the data and present our findings to a stakeholder board. This board will consist of community organizations and health policy organizations that will help us develop a set of recommendations for increasing access to telePrEP. During the second phase, we will select local PrEP-AP enrolling sites in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernandino counties and we will work closely with their staff to implement the recommendations from the first phase. We will use a second framework called the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) to evaluate our intervention by monitoring telePrEP uptake on a quarterly basis.

Many approaches to curing HIV seek to harness the power of anti-HIV T cells that are able to specifically recognize and kill cells in the body that are infected with HIV. Because T cells can become dysfunctional - or “exhausted” - during chronic HIV infection, we need to find approaches that prevent anti-HIV T cells from losing their function. In this proposal, we will test cutting-edge approaches to overcome anti-HIV T cell exhaustion that are being evaluated to improve T cell-based therapies for cancer, another setting where T cell exhaustion can hinder the efficacy of these treatments. Specifically, we will make anti-HIV T cells (called CAR-T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor T cells) that we genetically engineer to not become exhausted by targeting the expression of genes that control T cell exhaustion. We will target one gene that we have found gives anti-HIV T cells the ability to proliferate robustly when they encounter HIV. Using CRISPR technology for gene editing, we will then target several other genes that we hypothesize may have a similar effect based on our preliminary studies in T cells isolated from people with HIV who naturally control the infection and have highly functional anti-HIV T cells.

HIV-1 infection generally increases T-cell metabolism, which means that cells are more active, which promotes successful viral integration and replication. Our preliminary data show that although therapeutic T cell vaccination can effectively generate cytotoxic “killer” T cells that kill HIV-infected cells, in most cases this antiviral activity is insufficient to limit viral replication. It is critical to improve upon these promising vaccine strategies and to design novel approaches for enhancing vaccine-induced immunity. Given intriguing data indicating that rapamycin, a drug that targets T-cell metabolism and is used at high doses as an immunosuppressive agent, can enhance the magnitude and the quality of vaccine-induced virus specific memory T cells, we hypothesized that stringent post-treatment control requires both effective anti-SIV responses to a therapeutic vaccine and unfavorable metabolic conditions for viral replication. Here we propose to modulate the mTOR pathway during antiretroviral therapy interruption, to reduce T-cell activation and the avaliability of new target cells, and during vaccination, to enhance SIV-specific cellular immunity.

If left untreated, the destruction of CD4 cells makes it difficult for the body to fight infections, a condition known as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Despite 40 years of research, we still do not have a cure for HIV. Current anti-HIV drugs (also known as antiretrovirals) keep the virus under control but cannot eliminate it from the body, necessitating a life-long dependence on these drugs. However, some rare HIV-positive individuals can stay symptom-free and disease-free for years without any antiretroviral therapy and are called elite controllers or HIV long-term non-progressors. If we can crack the mystery of how these individuals keep HIV under control without drugs, then we can use that knowledge to find a cure for HIV. In some of these HIV controllers, it was found that their CD8 T-cells, another type of immune cells important for killing virus-infected cells in the body, can somehow stop the HIV virus from multiplying in the HIV-infected CD4 cells, without killing the latter. This phenomenon is called CD8 T cell non-cytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR). CD4 cell numbers are usually maintained well in such patients and they do not develop symptoms of immune deficiency. We aim to understand how CD8 cells stop HIV replication in CD4 cells. In the proposed project, we will use a type of molecular scissors called CRISPR-Cas9 to cut and mutate the genes of HIV-infected CD4 cells. This pool of mutated CD4 cells will be grown with CD8 cells from i) elite HIV controllers, ii) regular HIV patients, and/or iii) healthy individuals. If deletion of certain gene(s) in CD4 cells inhibits the antiviral activity of CD8 cells, then we can infer involvement of these genes in the antiviral response.

Despite the advent of anti-retroviral therapy, HIV remains a major public health concern: we still lack treatments to achieve a functional or sterilizing cure, as the virus can integrate into the host genome and remain latent for decades. The discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, allowing precise and efficient gene editing brought a new tool to the HIV cure field. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing allows mutational inactivation of HIV promoter or gene sequences and host-dependency factors such as HIV coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5. This system is currently being tested in an HIV cure-focused clinical trial. However, little is known about the ability of this system to efficiently edit HIV latently-infected cells in vivo. Latency is maintained through several mechanisms. Among these mechanisms, DNA methylation and chromatin condensation are of particular importance. DNA methylation is a mechanism through which methyl groups are transferred to cytosines in the CpG context to silence gene expression. Chromatin condensation is a mechanism that keeps DNA compact in a cell, and modulation of its state is directly correlated with gene expression: open chromatin regions tend to be transcriptionally active and closed regions are silenced. Both mechanisms contribute to viral silencing in latently-infected cells. However, several reports have shown that closed chromatin and methylated CpG impedes CRISPR-Cas9 editing. In this project, we propose to use epigenetic modulators to enhance anti-HIV CRISPR Cas9 editing in primary CD4+ T cells ex vivo. We will treat CD4+ T cells with methylation inhibitors or histone deacetylase inhibitors, involved in chromatin condensation, nucleofect treated cells with anti-HIV Cas9 ribonucleoproteins, and evaluate gene editing efficiency using Tracking of Indels by Decomposition analysis. In addition, we will study the role of CpG islands in the HIV provirus in CD4+ T cells using the CRISPRoff/Tet system, allowing targeted methylation or demethylation.

To date, mostly due to the extremely difficult accessibility of this area, data on HIV reservoir in human spinal cord is rare. This gap limits our possibility of designing effective strategies to target and eradicate the virus. In fact, differences among HIV reservoirs exist across the human body, and even a single site, where HIV reservoir can behave differently compared to others better characterized (e.g., brain, gut), can contribute to unexpected and unwanted outcomes of any curative attempt. 2) By investigating the relationship between the inflammation in cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the CNS) and the HIV reservoir in spinal cord, we will describe the contribution of this reservoir in fueling local activation of immune cells. Chronic inflammation occurs even when ART blocks HIV replication, and can cause mood, cognitive and neurological disorders. Our data will inform interventional strategies to modulate the inflammation behind HIV neuropathogenesis. 3) By describing the relationship between HIV reservoir, inflammation, and the levels of antiretrovirals in the spinal cord, we will provide data on the penetration and activity of antiretrovirals in this CNS region. Antiretrovirals penetration and activity both change according to drug and body region, with clinically important differences also across distinct brain areas, but largely unknown for spinal cord. This information will help in interpreting the other findings of this proposal and can better inform on the choice of ART when aiming for more neuro-protective or less neurotoxic regimens.

Antiretroviral drugs can inhibit HIV infection, but cannot eliminate the latently infected cells in the body that hide from the immune system. Developing an HIV cure requires the elimination of latently infected cells. To achieve this, this proposal is focused on strategies to eliminate these hidden reservoirs and accurately quantify their presence. By deepening our understanding of HIV latency, this proposal aims to explore new treatments targeting these cells. One potential avenue is enhancing the function and survival of natural killer cells, which have the inherent ability to target virally infected cells and are better tolerated than T cell-based therapies. This research utilizes a combination of novel chimeric antigen receptors designed to improve natural killer cell survival and function. Additionally, cutting-edge technologies such as genetic barcoded virus systems and deep sequencing multi-omic platforms enable the tracking of individual HIV clones as they circulate or hide within T cells.

For this reason, PWH must maintain their medication regimen for the duration of their lives, as stopping the medication will result in a rebound of the viral infection and the development of AIDS. The main barrier to a cure is the fact that the virus will hide in a person's DNA in tissues throughout the entire body, and we neither understand the mechanisms that control its re-expression from the DNA, nor how to reach these tissues outside the blood with effective therapy. Since the virus integrates into the DNA of the cells it infects, it becomes subject to the same mechanisms as those controlling the expression of human genes, and these mechanisms provide this control through impacting the 3D structure of the DNA. Therefore, we propose to characterize how the integration of the viral DNA affects the way HIV DNA interacts with the rest of the genome on a 3D level, alongside the types of molecular modifications that are made to the DNA to regulate viral expression. First, I am proposing experiments to understand these mechanisms in a cell model of latent infection using new and innovative technologies that enable evaluation in individual cells. Next, I propose to examine them in tissues of people from the 'Last Gift' cohort, which is a unique cohort of altruistic PWH who agree to donate their bodies for a rapid autopsy after they die of non-AIDS-related illnesses. Data are already being generated from the 'Last Gift' that allows us to examine viral genetic sequences, where the virus is located in the DNA, and which types of cells it is infecting throughout the body.

Long-acting injectable (LAI) PrEP offers a promising and preferred strategy for PWUD, yet effective interventions to improve linkage and retention in HIV preventive care are urgently needed. To develop best practices for engaging PWUD in LAI-PrEP services, we propose enrolling participants to receive LAI-PrEP via two novel recruitment methods: (1) community-based recruitment and service delivery via collaboration between the Harm Reduction Coalition of San Diego (HRCSD) and UCSD’s Owen Clinic and (2) hospital-based recruitment and referral to the Owen Clinic via a dedicated Care Navigator. First, the community-based outreach method will consist of mobile LAI-PrEP services provided at various community locations in conjunction with harm reduction services provided by the HRCSD; this partnership will support expanding the HRCSD’s services to include LAI-PrEP, which will be offered to all eligible and interested PWUD. Second, our hospital-based recruitment method will leverage the Owen Clinic’s proximity to UCSD’s Hillcrest Medical Center, a safety net hospital where many PWUD receive care; eligible individuals will be referred to initiate PrEP. Study participants at either site will receive comprehensive screening and treatment for HIV, HCV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and referrals for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and behavioral therapies for SUD at baseline and at bimonthly follow-up visits. In total, we will enroll 200 PWUD to receive LAI-PrEP (n=100 via UCSD Hillcrest Medical Center hospital-based recruitment and n=100 via HRCSD’s mobile community-based outreach). We hypothesize that compared with traditional care models, mobile service delivery will demonstrate higher retention in care (45% of persons starting PrEP continue PrEP at 26 weeks, defined as having received two doses of LAI-PrEP following baseline enrollment). We further hypothesize that PWUD receiving medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and LAI-PrEP will be more likely to be retained in care for PrEP at 26 weeks when compared to persons using LAI-PrEP alone.

However, there are currently no approved medications to treat methamphetamine use disorder (MAUD), and existing therapies have demonstrated limited success. This has created a substantial barrier in addressing the HIV epidemic and highlights the need for new approaches toward tackling MAUD. Over the past decade, treatment with ketamine--an FDA-approved medication--has repeatedly been shown to rapidly relieve symptoms of major depression, anxiety, and suicidality in the general population, and studies have suggested promising potential of ketamine therapy in treating other substance use disorders (SUDs), including cocaine, alcohol, and opioid use disorders. Ketamine is thought to work by restoring the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, which may support an individual's ability to learn and adopt new, healthier behaviors. However, access to both ketamine and psychotherapy are limited, particularly for low-income patients and those in the San Francisco Health Network's MediCal program. Moreover, the feasibility and efficacy of ketamine in treating MAUD have not yet been explored. To address this gap, we will conduct a pilot clinical trial of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) with 12 publicly insured patients who engage in HIV risk behaviors and are seeking treatment for MAUD in residential drug treatment programs in San Francisco. The study intervention will consist of 7 behavioral therapy sessions in combination with 3 monitored administrations of intramuscular ketamine delivered by a therapist and medical professional trained in KAP over an approximately 35-day period. While the primary goal will be to evaluate whether this novel, low-cost KAP intervention can be successfully implemented to serve publicly insured patients with MAUD, secondary objectives will include preliminary evaluations of the safety and efficacy of this approach in reducing methamphetamine use and HIV risk behaviors.

Current state-level data demonstrates there have also been substantial increases in both opioid overdose deaths and HIV diagnoses among people who use drugs. Further, Orange County, California has been identified as an Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) priority jurisdiction due to the high prevalence of HIV diagnoses in the region. Exacerbating this documented need for HIV and overdose prevention efforts in the county, people who use drugs have numerous barriers to accessing healthcare including stigma, homelessness, and transportation challenges. Further, Orange County’s political climate has been hostile towards state-approved, evidence-based HIV prevention and harm reduction strategies for people who use drugs (e.g., syringe service programs). As such, there is a critical need for novel HIV prevention and harm reduction efforts to improve health outcomes for people who use drugs in this region. In response, the proposed research project seeks to explore the feasibility and acceptability of harm reduction vending machines (HVRMs) among people who use drugs and relevant service providers, law enforcement, and community members in Orange County, California. HVRMs are innovative, low-barrier technology-based options that expand access to supplies and engage harder to reach populations by dispensing HIV and harm reduction materials such as syringes, naloxone, fentanyl test strips, condoms, and HIV, hepatitis C, and STI self-test kits. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), the proposed research will engage in qualitative research methods to assess the perceived barriers and facilitators to HVRM adoption and implementation, potential HVRM locations, and desired materials for inclusion in HVRMs via in-depth interventions with approximately 20-30 people who use drugs (Aim 1) and via key informant interviews with approximately 20-30 staff, clinicians, and health care professionals serving people who use drugs, law enforcement, and community members (Aim 2) in Orange County.

Individuals who report injection drug use as their HIV transmission risk factor have the lowest rates of viral suppression of all demographic groups in San Diego. Further, individuals with HIV who use methamphetamine in San Diego have lower retention in care and HIV viral suppression rates compared to individuals with HIV who do not use methamphetamine. Traditional HIV care models that require patients to secure transportation, schedule appointments, and navigate burdensome administrative processes are especially challenging for people who use drugs. Novel implementation strategies, including low barrier mobile approaches to HIV primary care and technology that transcend traditional care models, are necessary to better engage this population in HIV primary care. The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Owen Clinic which is the largest and most comprehensive HIV Medicine Clinic in San Diego aims to establish and evaluate low barrier mobile technology and HIV primary care services in close collaboration with the County of San Diego Harm Reduction Program. We propose parking a UCSD mobile unit adjacent to the newly established County of San Diego mobile syringe service program unit with the goal of meeting people who use drugs where they are at. This project will support the establishment of key infrastructure (telehealth, electronic storage lockers with key pads for participant medication and substance use equipment storage, and vein finding equipment for phlebotomy in people who inject drugs) trained personnel, and data recording systems to enable the implementation and evaluation of low barrier mobile technology and HIV primary care to address the ongoing HIV public health crisis and work toward ending the HIV epidemic in San Diego.

Spatial approaches to improving health of minoritized populations is critical since geographic access can pose significant barriers to uptake of interventions. Given the vast geography of the LA county region, it is imperative to better understand how different technologies will work in differing areas so that relevant needs are addressed adequately. Preliminary research by the PI has identified unique geo-spatial patterns that suggest different low barrier technologies will be relevant in different areas based on social behaviors (e.g., where people living with HV experiencing homelessness sleep, where SMM engage in sexual encounters, and where SMM engage in substance use, etc.). Effective low-barrier HIV prevention and care must be delivered in the right place and at the right time. Low barrier technologies for HIV prevention and care are especially important for people who are insecurity housed. Sexual minority populations experience housing insecurity at rates higher than heterosexual populations, especially SMM of color. Housing insecurity is predictive of poor self-rated health among SMM, poor mental health, and poor HIV-related outcomes. The mechanisms that link housing insecurity to poor HIV outcomes include delayed, reduced or postponed health care or medications, higher rates of mental health disorders, substance use, and poor adherence to HIV treatment.

Accurately identifying people who are out of care or who are at risk of falling out of care is vital so that public health workers can allocate resources and preventive services to those that need it most. Currently, public health services use routinely collected HIV data such as viral load or other blood tests to identify PWH who have not accessed HIV care in more than a year. Outreach personnel then try to contact these people and help them find where to get care. This is known as 'data-to-care'. However, reports would suggest that this strategy is inefficient as many PWH identified using data-to-care have in fact moved out of the area, are in care elsewhere, or are uncontactable. In addition, there is a substantial delay to outreach as a person must be without labs for more than 1 year to be eligible. Machine learning (ML) is a tool whereby researchers use new statistical techniques to study patterns in data that can sometimes predict outcomes. For instance, irregular viral load testing might be suggestive of a person who is only partially engaged with care. We propose to use machine learning techniques on HIV data reported routinely to the San Diego Public Health Department to see if it can improve the identification of PWH who are out of care or at risk of falling out of care. We will compare which ML techniques provide the best results and which patterns of data provide the most information. Once we have selected the best ML techniques and data selection, we will compare the ML techniques to the existing data-to-care program to gauge if the ML can be more efficient in selecting which PWH would benefit from additional resources. Preliminary results performed by our group indicated that about half of PWH identified using ML will be out of care or not on treatment in the next year which would be a substantial improvement on current data-to-care activities.

From 2017 to 2021, AI/AN experienced a 16% increase in new HIV diagnosis while it remained stable or decreased for most other racial/ethnic groups in the United States. About 20% of AI/AN living with HIV are unaware of their infection status, compared to 13% of the general U.S. population. Additionally, AI/AN face higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, suggesting a heightened risk for HIV. To address these disparities, our academic team partnered with a Southern California Tribe to explore the integration of HIV self-testing within a Tribal Wellness program. We found a preference for home-based testing over clinic-based options, with nearly half of survey participants expressing interest in obtaining self-test kits through the Tribal Wellness program. Building on this successful collaboration, we initiated a new project to evaluate an overdose prevention vending machine (ODPVM) that dispenses free naloxone. In its first year, the ODPVM was used over 100 times, demonstrating strong community engagement. We aim to expand upon this work by introducing a smart vending machine that provides low-barrier access to HIV testing and other harm reduction resources and services. Using a community-based participatory research approach, we will conduct a formative evaluation with the following aims: 1. Assess the feasibility and appropriateness of delivering HIV self-testing kits and prevention resources through a vending machine. 2. Identify facilitators and barriers to implementing a smart vending machine on American Indian tribal lands. 3. Develop partnerships for delivering HIV prevention and harm reduction services via a smart vending machine.

These findings suggest that current strategies for ending the epidemic, including the use of low-barrier technologies for prevention and treatment, are not reaching unhoused individuals at the same rate they reach those with stable housing. Unhoused individuals face daily challenges to meeting basic needs that make HIV prevention and treatment a last priority. Continual displacement of unsheltered homeless people further disrupts their ability to access care: encampment sweeps lead to the loss of belongings and create literal and relational distance between healthcare providers and clients, both of which can disrupt access to HIV interventions. Safe sleeping, or sanctioned encampment, sites may minimize the disruption in access to HIV technologies. Such sites provide individuals with a place to sleep without fear of being ticketed, pushed out, or arrested. Safe sleeping sites are low-barrier, meaning that individuals do not need identification to enter and do not need to adhere to sobriety rules (although they cannot use substances on-site). Clients are able to access a range of services, including showers, laundry, food, and medical care. Because safe sleeping provides individuals with a settled location, they may be an important site for mobile health services and the implementation of low barrier technology HIV interventions, including the use of medication adherence phone apps, vending machines for HIV testing kits, or safe boxes for storing belongings. This study will take place in the City of San Diego. San Diego is one of 50 jurisdictions that account for more than half of all new HIV diagnoses in the U.S.. High transmission rates in the city may in part be connected to the high volume of people experiencing homelessness. San Diego opened two safe sleeping sites in October, 2023 after the city policymakers banned homeless encampments in public places.

However, drug resistance, including to the latest generation ART, is becoming a more pervasive clinical problem. Because resistant viruses typically replicate less efficiently than non-resistant viruses, whether a drug resistant mutation (DRM) persists in the viral population depends on the intricate tradeoff between resistance and fitness. Here, we note one important and novel consideration. The occurrence and effect of DRMs in response to ART are strongly dependent on the specific genetic sequence background in which the mutation occurs. Previously, we showed that the fitness effect of primary DRMs can vary widely within and between patient populations due to epistatic interactions of the DRM with the sequence background of the virus. Accordingly, laboratory-derived molecular HIV clones, such as NL4-3, HxB2, or LAI IIIB, often fail to accurately reflect the complex genetic backgrounds of patient-derived viral sequences. Unfortunately, current methods for evaluating fitness effects of patient-derived DRMs rely on these same laboratory-derived molecular viral clones. To address this discrepancy, we propose to develop a novel machine-learning-based lightweight and ready-to-use software to predict the differential effects of DRMs premised on individual patient sequence backgrounds. The proposed software will leverage comprehensive HIV sequence data from patients in the Stanford and Los Alamos HIV databases to predict the fitness effects of DRMs in various patient-derived sequences. We aim to provide an accurate, easy-to-use, and reliable tool that can be developed as an application for clinicians for the potential assessment of drug resistance in patients, thus facilitating the development of tailored treatment strategies, including but not limited to the prescription of better combination regimens. This tool would represent a significant advance in bridging the gap between laboratory-based predictions and real-world patient scenarios.

Lamellar membranes based on homogeneous 2D-materials have demonstrated intriguing performance for water treatment, but suffered from poor selectivity, membrane swelling, stacking defects, or poor stability. To address these problems, I propose to develop heterogenous lamellar membranes by combining Graphene Oxide (GO) with porous nanosheets such as Zeolite and MoS2. Heterogenous stacking of GO-Zeolite/MoS2 nanosheets can minimize membrane swelling by rebalancing the attractive and repulsive forces between layers, thus improving stability of the interlamellar spacing and membrane selectivity. In-plane pores on porous nanosheets and the interlamellar nanochannels provide hybrid transport pathways for molecules, which could be exploited to transcend the permeability-selectivity tradeoff of conventional membrane materials. Together with swelling control, a major goal of my study is to understand the hybrid transport mechanisms in the heterogeneous membranes to achieve high separation performance. I propose to incorporate 2D nanosheets onto a single-nanopore substrate and investigate ion transport using patch clamp technique. This analysis will isolate the molecular transport through in-plane pores and nanochannels by altering substrate pore size and thickness of deposited nanosheets. Molecular transport will be likely dominated by in-plane pores when the substrate pore is small, while transport through nanochannels will be more pronounced with larger substrate pore and thicker nanosheets deposition. TEM-compatible, single-pore silicon nitride membrane will be used as membrane substrate to facilitate device imaging and characterization.

Despite intense efforts, the formation, transport, and spin polarization mechanisms of these excitons are not well understood. My dissertation is focused on understanding exciton behavior in halide perovskites through a wide variety of transport and spectroscopic experimentation coupled to theoretical simulations. Recently, we developed unique fabrication procedures that allow for the novel study of exciton transport under a wide range of temperature and charge density conditions in single crystalline perovskites. We also revealed indirect signatures of excitonic dominance over charge diffusion in perovskites up to technologically relevant temperatures. This Fellowship will allow me to leverage these breakthroughs and visualize exciton dynamics under several key experimental avenues - space, time, spectrum, and dimensionality (3D bulk to 2D molecular layers), with an aim of understanding and manipulating excitonic responses. Through a combination of spatially, temporally, and spectrally resolved temperature-dependent fluorescence and absorption microscopies, we will reveal an increasing excitonic population at low temperatures and provide direct evidence of its connection to enhanced photoinduced carrier diffusion behavior. Furthermore, we will utilize LANL’s ultrafast optical microscopy facilities to study the formation and recombination dynamics of the excitons in 2D and 3D samples, thus validating dimensionality as an important tuning parameter for their photovoltaic response.

However, this is not the only blueprint for achieving rigidity, high strength, and abrasion resistance in composites. The Humboldt squid and several carnivorous marine worms have ""biotools"" (beaks, jaws or teeth) that exhibit impressive mechanical performance yet contain little or no inorganic mineral content. The bloodworm Glycera dibranchiata offers an interesting example, as its load- and impact-resistant jaws are comprised of a network of proteins, mostly unmineralized copper and melanin. The use of melanin as a structural component is a unique design concept not found elsewhere, as the typical biological roles of melanin are pigmentation and photoprotection. Limited prior studies of Glycera jaws revealed hard, strong, and tough mechanical properties- on par with or even exceeding human bone- despite minimal degree of mineralization (<1%). However, the formation of these biocomposites, the exact role of melanin, and the synergy among the various components in the Glycera jaw remain poorly understood. The principal objectives of this research are to elucidate the structure-property relationships of melanin, proteins, and metal building blocks in the jaw and to use this information to inform the design of future lightweight high-performance composites. To unravel this mystery, we will investigate the jaws' molecular and nanoscale mechanics, the morphology and structure of melanin, and the interactions among individual constituents in Glycera jaws by leveraging state-of-the-art 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) and single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS). In addition, since melanin is known for its extraordinary radioactive shielding properties in organisms exposed to high background radiation levels, we will investigate whether these biocomposites exhibit any radioprotective capabilities.

Much of this increase in atmospheric CH4 has been attributed to greater inter-annual and seasonal variability in climate and water table in tropical wetlands. Tropical ecosystems are projected to undergo large changes in precipitation, which may lead to even larger changes in atmospheric CH4. There are significant gaps in global carbon budgets and climate predictions due to the lack of carbon cycling data from tropical wetlands. Filling in these gaps will help better predict how the large carbon stocks in these soils will respond to future environmental change. The goal of this proposed work will be to assess the environmental controls on methanogenesis and methanotrophy in deep soil profiles across tropical wetland ecosystems where 104 Gt of global carbon is stored. Specifically, we will examine surface and soil profile flux to accurately predict changes in future CH4 efflux. This will be the first assessment of CH4 dynamics in tropical wetlands below 1m, where the majority of CH4 is produced. This project will measure radiocarbon using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) to determine source of CH4 from tropical wetlands.

As such, training will focus on AMS runs, and modeling and interpretation of data under the mentorship of Dr. Karis McFarlane.

These alloys can exhibit desirable combinations of properties, such as strength, toughness and corrosion resistance, which make them attractive for a range of potential applications in energy, transportation and national security sectors. Due to their composition, and the disordered nature of their atomic structure, these alloys display a statistical distribution of local atomic environments that underlie their ability to host a variety of different deformation mechanisms, and that can affect diffusive transport at high temperatures or under irradiation. An important issue for their design then becomes the exact nature of these statistical distributions, i.e., whether they are characteristic of perfectly random compositional disorder, or possess differing degrees of local atomic short-range order (SRO). Understanding the kinetic processes that govern the formation and destruction of SRO is necessary for optimizing properties in the processing of CCAs, as well as controlling their performance in extreme conditions. The proposed scope of this research is to use advanced atomistic computer simulations to investigate these questions surrounding the kinetics of SRO formation and its effect on diffusive transport of relevant point defects. A major limitation with current computer simulation methods at the relevant atomistic length scales is reaching diffusive timescales without simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy and general applicability. Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) scientists have pioneered the development of a suite of tools to overcome this limitation, called Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (AMD). Working with LANL scientists, AMD methods will be applied to simulate the kinetics of SRO formation, and to understand its impact on point defect diffusion. The work will focus initially on a concentrated Ni-Cr alloy, a material central to LANL’s Fundamental Understanding of Transport Under Reactor Extremes (FUTURE) project. Results obtained spanning simulation parameters of temperature, solute, and defect concentration will allow for the development and validation of theoretical models that can predict transport kinetics in systems with SRO, thus opening this analysis to CCA materials more broadly.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Anas Abu-Odeh,,,,"University of California, Berkeley",https://ror.org/01an7q238,ROR,https://ror.org/,2021-04-01,Issued,,L21GF3646,award-number,,,,,,

Leading supercomputers provide unprecedented capabilities through a combined prowess of large multi-core CPUs and several high-performant GPUs on each computational node. While heterogeneous architectures have demonstrated effectiveness in solving large and complex scientific problems, there still exist many opportunities to improve the returns on investments in this relatively new paradigm. In particular, although significant speedup can be reaped by porting the computationally expensive operations to the GPUs or by using dedicated I/O nodes, the corresponding data movement costs may substantially compensate for the overall gains. Identification of such data movement penalties, in particular, to and from I/O nodes, between CPUs and GPUs, and across memory hierarchies, can shed new light on the associated bottlenecks, leading to development of new ways to improve the utilization of these architectures. We propose to develop new visual analysis techniques to enable a detailed investigation of data movement costs and investigate their impact on the application’s performance. We will develop a new framework to allow holistic exploration of data movement to satiate the need for large-scale heterogeneous computing. Focusing on the need for in-situ exploration, e.g., for understanding the data costs of training deep neural networks, we will visualize streaming performance data enabling real-time exploration for applications on heterogeneous machines. Although one may use known metrics to analyze the performance of applications, such an approach is primarily useful for validating/invalidating their hypothesis. Whereas developing new conjectures about the causes and potential solutions to performance problems is typically not possible. Our framework will inform code developers, computational scientists, and HPC researchers of possible ways to improve machine utilization and efficiently run larger and communication-demanding applications, e.g., by identifying incompatible job placement, and hardware latencies and communication patterns.

Scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) are heavily invested in understanding these materials’ behavior in the field. It is known that under extreme thermal and irradiation conditions, metallic nuclear components display unique material response. Traditional theory dictates that metals weaken under elevated temperatures, due to the increased mobilization of microscopic defects, such as dislocations. However, experimental observations show a clear temperature insensitive regime, and only at a critical temperature does the stress expectedly decrease. Furthermore, irradiation of metals and alloys induces the formation of additional defects. Thus, exposure to radiation affects the critical temperature, but the coupled effect of radiation and temperature is not fully understood. Specifically, dislocation motion and interactions with irradiation defects are operative at microscopic length scales and high speeds, making them difficult to observe experimentally. Additionally, conventional materials characterization techniques are often insufficient to function in extreme environments properly and safely. Thus, understanding dislocation-defect interactions in nuclear materials requires predictive, multi-physics, three-dimensional simulation capabilities. My project aims to study these interactions in face-centered cubic metals, such as stainless steel, using the phase-field dislocation dynamics (PFDD) model. Collaboration with LANL is critical to this work, as the PFDD code originated there and the lab is home to scientists who continue to develop it. PFDD operates on a scale in which individual dislocations, defects, and their interactions can be modeled. We plan to study thermal effects on mechanical response due to dislocation/irradiation defect interactions by modeling temperature via a combined PFDD-kinetic Monte Carlo framework. At the critical temperature, we hypothesize that changes in dislocation behavior in the presence of irradiation-induced defects affects material softening; thus, irradiation rate plays a role in determining the critical temperature.

It is known that after a dry season, a precipitation event can cause a jolt of activity reawakening soil communities. Recent studies from UC Davis and LLNL have shown that the number of viral species in grassland soils is related to soil moisture. In other systems, phosphorus concentrations can affect the number of virus particles produced during infection. Current approaches to study viral communities only target specific types of viruses, and the viral signal is heavily occluded by microbial DNA and extracellular DNA that persists in soils — leaving us without the ability to observe how actively infecting viruses may contribute to microbial and viral community assembly and terrestrial nutrient cycles, such as the carbon cycle. Leveraging recent advances in DNA sequencing a first-of-its-type study observing the complete lifecycle of viruses in grassland soils after a simulated precipitation was performed at LLNL. This was achieved by creating microcosms with dry grassland soils, simulating a precipitation event by adding natural abundance water or oxygen-heavy water, then adding potassium phosphate to half of the microcosms, and sampling the microcosms weekly for three weeks. The DNA were extracted from these microcosms to capture all virus types and density fractions were separated (based on heavy oxygen incorporation) of microbial and viral DNA and sequenced using a novel high-throughput stable isotope probing pipeline pioneered at LLNL. Additionally, extracellular DNA and viral particle DNA were extracted from collected soils. This amount of sequencing generated an enormous dataset of viral and microbial genetic data creating an opportunity to leverage the supercomputer and bioinformatic expertise found at LLNL to process the data. From these data, we will track the production and persistence of viruses as they cycle from actively killing their hosts and producing virus particles or remain as integrated viruses in their host capable of metabolic rewiring. These data will give us further insight into the impact of viral communities on soil microbiome structuring and a better understanding of how viruses respond to environmental changes and how virus-host dynamics could impact the carbon cycle and other terrestrial nutrient cycles.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Grant Gogul,,,,"University of California, Davis",https://ror.org/05rrcem69,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-04-01,Issued,,L24GF7828,award-number,,,,,,

The failure of these drums can be catastrophic, exposing personnel and assets to radioactive contamination. For instance, a breach in a drum at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in 2014 resulted in a $54 million fine for the U.S. Department of Energy. Thus, the need to frequently and reliably monitor the structural integrity of these storage drums is clear. Current inspection techniques rely on human examination of containers stored in underground facilities, using handheld sensors. This process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and exposes personnel to a hazardous environment. Developing robots for autonomous inspection of nuclear waste drums could address these challenges and enable the reliable inspection of hard-to-reach hazardous areas. My current research focuses on real-time defect detection on metallic structures using noncontact air-coupled ultrasonic transducers. To demonstrate this technology, our team attaches a sensor-holding prototype, developed in-house, under a train car and collects data from rails while the train travels. The data consists of ultrasonic guided waves generated by the wheel-rail friction that leaks into air. Under the guidance of Dr. Lanza di Scalea, I developed algorithms that combine signal and image processing techniques, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning to transform the data into a 97% probability of defect detection using an unsupervised learning approach. My proposed project will demonstrate that this methodology is independent of the structure being inspected, and I can expand it to detect flaws in not only nuclear waste storage drums, but also nuclear reactors and their components. Working with LANL will provide me with the resources to ultimately develop a successful autonomous inspection device. The Laboratory is a major stakeholder at WIPP, with access to the structures of interest, the sensors used for inspection, previously acquired data, and a skilled robotics team.

Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are highly promising candidates because of their tunable mechanical properties and easy manufacturability. However, existing SPEs often exceed a thickness of 100 μm, compromising the energy density advantage of LMBs. To address this conundrum, we propose to leverage high-resolution 3D printing, an additive manufacturing technology, to fabricate ultrathin porous membranes (in collaboration with the LLNL mentor, Dr. Jianchao Ye). These membranes will serve as a foundation for the fabrication of ultrathin SPEs (approximately 20 μm) with precise formulations, physicochemical properties, and mechanical characteristics for solid-state LMBs. Three interrelated tasks are proposed to achieve the project’s overarching goal: (1) Fabrication and optimization of ultrathin SPEs based on 3D-printed membranes, allowing for tunable porosity, thickness, and pattern. As a model system, we will incorporate the polyacrylate-based polymer (previously developed by our group) with 3D-printed membranes to assess compatibility. (2) Integration of an additive-engineering strategy to stabilize the lithium-SPE interface. Various film-forming additives will be introduced into the ultrathin SPEs, aiming to formulate stable solid-electrolyte interphases and eliminate corrosive side reactions on the anode side. (3) Incorporation of functional ceramic fillers into ultrathin SPEs to enhance dendritic suppression capability. Our plan involves introducing functional fillers, including ceramic anode materials that exhibit zero-volt stability. These fillers will enable the self-consumption of any lithium filament formed inside SPEs, thereby improving the safety performance of the battery.

Within LLNL, it also underpins several of core missions, such as the Stockpile Stewardship program. Although corrosion is a thermodynamically driven process, its practical impact can be minimized by controlling key chemical processes that dictate the early stages of corrosion initiation. However, most existing corrosion and aging models are developed to describe the steady-state conditions that occur late in the reaction. To address this critical knowledge gap, this proposal will integrate state-of-the-art experimental characterization, multiscale simulations, and data science to elucidate factors that control initiation of localized corrosion—one of the most notorious processes that degrade materials. This proposal will focus on Aluminum (Al) and Al-based alloys that are highly relevant to ongoing LLNL activities. An initial study of polycrystalline, single-phase Al will provide a foundational for more complex alloys where impurities, inclusions, and phase segregation are also considered. We aim to investigate when and how local localized corrosion is impacted by variations in the local structure and composition due to the delocalized nature of galvanic processes.

The student will also be trained to model materials corrosion with multiscale simulations and data science approaches. In particular, orientation, compositions and work function derived from electron microscopy, SECM, and ab-initio simulations will provide inputs for a machine learning model that to provide a priori indicators of where degradation will initiate.

WSe2, MoTe2 and HfTe5 are van der Waals materials - a class of materials that exhibit weak out-of-plane bonding which allows them to be mechanically exfoliated into atomically thin two-dimensional sheets. It has been demonstrated that strain provides a controllable method to tune the electronic properties of other van der Waals materials.

Recently, more and more data is becoming available due to the wide deployment of smart meters, smart sensors, and upgraded communication networks. Thus, data-driven control techniques, especially reinforcement learning (RL), have attracted surging attention for DERs coordination and control. However, major hurdles remain before the deployment of RL for DERs control. For power systems, failure to maintain stability and safety can lead to violation of regulatory requirements or even catastrophic consequences, e.g., blackouts. In addition, traditional RL relies on extensive data to succeed, while data for power system operations is typically limited and data collection can be time-consuming.

The recent breakthrough in achieving controlled ignition at LLNL’s National Ignition Facility has sparked renewed interest in advanced methods for Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE). However, the conventional ignition method relies on intense laser beams to drive both compression and heating in the target, which restricts the maximum efficiency and feasibility for energy applications. Electron Fast Ignition (EFI) is an exciting alternative that decouples these processes by first compressing the fuel and then heating the target with laser-generated electrons, which can yield more energy for fusion. Generating hot electrons from lasers is very efficient but depositing their energy into the fusion fuel poses a two-fold challenge: 1) electrons tend to scatter away before reaching the target, and 2) many of the electrons are too energetic to stop in the target center. In order to tackle these two challenges LLNL has recently funded an IFE Strategic Initiative in which the lab mentor is leading a study of the complex electron physics in EFI. As part of this broader campaign, the fellowship work will focus on developing a comprehensive understanding of how electron collimation depends on resistivity gradients – these are responsible for pushing electrons into collimated beams. Direct measurement of the resistivity gradient is challenging; instead, it must be inferred from electron conductivity models together with temperature measurements – both are crucial for understanding the collimation mechanism. The measurements will be made utilizing the lab’s unique time-resolved spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy instruments at facilities such as LLNL’s Jupiter Laser Facility.

This research program aims to demonstrate an artificial intelligence (AI) approach to efficiently sample the vast compositional space for accelerating the design of ultrastrong tungsten alloys with improved radiation swelling resistance. By collaborating with a scientist at LLNL, my objective is to deploy a closed-loop design framework combining recent AI, scientific machine learning, and atomistic simulations. Utilizing on-lattice atomic structure and chemistry model developed by my advisor, alongside machine learning models from our lab mentor, I plan to model the entire refractory space. Our goal is to accurately and efficiently predict defect diffusion barriers, aiming to trap and localize defects and reduce void growth through precise chemical manipulation. This project aligns perfectly with my training and career objectives, offering an invaluable opportunity for specialized training at a national laboratory. Through the In-Residence Fellowship, I will access world-class computational resources and receive comprehensive mentorship from both my UC dissertation advisor and a national lab mentor.

It is determined by the dry mass and water content of fuels, influenced by water potential (an indicator of plant water stress), and varies with environmental conditions and plant traits over days to months. In both dead and live fuels, moisture content can vary seasonally by 100% and diurnally by 10%, with significant differences among fuel types. Contemporary fire behavior models incorporate fuel moisture as a key variable but often rely on limited and generalized fuel classifications based on average estimations of fuel size and type. This simplification overlooks the variability in fuels and their interactions with environmental conditions. Additionally, changing climate regimes and extreme drought conditions necessitate an updated understanding of moisture response in forest fuels, especially during wildfire seasons. Our research aims to bridge this gap by investigating real-time variations in fuel moisture content from a biophysical perspective. By investigating water transport processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum for live and dead forest fuels, we aim to link water potential to fuel moisture using pressure–volume curves. We will also analyze how climatic factors such as precipitation, temperature, and evaporation affect fuel moisture from individual plants to entire forests and ecosystems. Field measurements of fuel moisture content will be supplemented with remote sensing data from MODIS and Sentinel-1. These insights will be integrated into ensemble deep learning models for real-time updates and predictions. By providing high-resolution and real-time fuel moisture estimation and prediction, and integrating these data into existing fire models, such as QUIC-Fire and FIRETEC, we aim to enhance these models' capabilities from ideal experimental landscapes and fuel structures to real-world scenarios. Our research seeks to make contributions to the field of fire behavior modeling and prescribed fire planning, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of fire management strategies.

Soil fungi have demonstrated a responsiveness to their environment and are capable of allocating growth and altering the composition of organic exudates in response to contrasting mineral substrates and nutrient conditions. While fungal hyphae operate at the microscale, fungal networks span millions of kilometers worldwide, significantly contributing to soil formation, mineral weathering, and nutrient cycling processes at landscape scales. However, it is difficult to assess the active growth of the soil fungal population as a majority of the fungal network is dormant or senesced. This work will utilize stable isotope tracing methods (13C) to investigate the active use of plant-derived carbon by soil fungi in controlled laboratory experiments. Fungal-accessible mesh bags containing unweathered rock (quartz, granite, basalt) will be buried in the soil of sorghum growth chambers as part of a 13CO2-enriched experiment at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Upon retrieval, Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS) will be utilized to map and characterize the 13C-enrichment of fungal biomass and mineral-associated exudates. To investigate the integration of 13C into fungal DNA, density gradient separations will be performed and High-Throughput Stable Isotope Probing (HT-SIP) will be employed, allowing for sequencing (amplicon or metagenomic) and taxonomic and functional identification. Ultimately this work aims to leverage stable isotope tracing methods to advance our understanding of the use and integration of photosynthetic carbon by soil fungi.

This process occurs when peripheral nerves that detect pathogens or inflammation are activated and relay this information back to the central nervous system. In the brain, this information is coordinated in unique brain centers, resulting in neuronal signaling and the release of neurotransmitters that can alter physiology in various organs. Many immune cells are responsive to neurotransmitters, and a few subtypes are also capable of producing and releasing them. For example, a highly specialized subset of B- and T-cells express the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and can release acetylcholine. Previous work has shown that ChAT+ immune cells can regulate immune cell recruitment during viral infection of the meninges, which surround the brain and spinal cord. During viral encephalitis, immune cells penetrate the blood brain barrier and increase inflammation detrimentally, with long-lasting impacts in speech, memory, and sleep in some patients. The precise mechanisms by which immune cells are recruited into the brain, and the role of neuroimmune circuits in their recruitment and activation, remain undefined. Defining the immune cell subsets that induce maladaptive inflammation in the brain and the mechanisms that lead to their recruitment is critical to identify potential targets for limiting immunopathology during viral encephalitis. The proposed research utilizes the expertise of researchers at LLNL in infectious disease and single cell transcriptomics. To elucidate if neuroimmune circuits can reduce immunopathology during viral infection, mouse models of encephalitic viral pathogens currently established in Dr. Weilhammer’s lab will be used alongside preexisting electrical neurostimulation procedures and unique genetic models from Dr. Reardon’s lab. Additionally, the use of LLNL’s established single-cell RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis pipeline will be leveraged to gain insight into the mechanisms by which neuroimmune circuits modulate cell behavior during viral infection and aid in the identification of potential therapeutic targets.

The drought was bracketed by two extremely wet years in 2010 and 2016, and was accompanied by unprecedented tree mortality and wildfire in California’s wildlands. Over the 21st century, climate scientists predict continued warming and an increase in swings between extremely wet and dry conditions. Since wet conditions favor vegetation regrowth and fuels buildup, and warm, dry conditions favor forest dieback and wildfire, these predictions raise questions critical for California’s future: Are the extreme forest dieback and fire conditions seen during the recent drought a harbinger of even greater future changes? What do future changes mean for California’s unique ecosystems, forest and fire management practices, and economy? Here we propose an effort to answer these questions through collaboration among climate scientists, satellite experts, vegetation modelers, fire scientists, and ecologists. The project will be grounded in analysis of observed relationships between fire, tree mortality, and climatic conditions during the recent drought. We will then develop computer simulations of climate, vegetation, and fire to determine the causes of recent tree mortality and fire variations. We will quantify the role of recent climate change in worsening the observed forest dieback and fire. The project’s capstone will be high-resolution climate change projections to simulate the impact of warming and increases in precipitation extremes on 21st century vegetation growth, fire, and forest dieback. We will also assess how future forest and fire management might evolve to mitigate the largest impacts of climate change on California’s wildlands. The first-of-their-kind climate, vegetation, and fire simulations will deepen our understanding of the complex interactions within California’s wildlands, and will leave a technological legacy in the form of a modeling framework that is easily applied to other regions.

As the deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar panels and energy storage devices is proliferating, electricity distribution systems are becoming drastically more complex and more dynamic. There are numerous inputs and controls pushed and pulled from these emerging energy resources and other grid equipment, some of which connect the resources to the public Internet. Further, the installation of millions of smart electricity meters and recent breakthroughs in micro-synchrophasor sensors and smart inverter controls are accelerating the rate at which measurement data is generated and control commands are dispatched.

The approach is to examine hydrologic sensitivities to changing climate and water demand through models and the historical record. The goal is to provide information to optimize water storage, quality, and groundwater sustainability as precipitation varies, temperatures warm, and population grows.

The majority of these emissions come from manure, where emission rates are thought to differ greatly among different manure management techniques. In order to fulfill statewide emission reduction goals for short-lived climate pollutants, the California Air Resources Board has recently targeted CH4 emission sources for near-term mitigation. However, few studies of CH4 emissions from dairy manure have been performed in California. Recent top-down atmospheric observations and inverse model analyses of atmospheric CH4 and N2O levels in the San Joaquin Valley suggest that emissions from dairy agriculture are underestimated in the state inventory. However, the dearth of California-specific information leads to uncertainty in the state inventory that poses an obstacle to efficient, well-informed mitigation planning for emissions from this sector. In addition, the efficacy of proposed mitigation solutions, such as anerobic digesters for manure waste, is not well quantified or tested in practice. We propose to combine top-down atmospheric methods with bottom-up process-level measurements and operational insight to improve both facility specific and regionally integrated estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from management practices at California dairies. Using a unique combination of subject area knowledge, high resolution data sets, biogeochemistry, atmospheric composition observations, and inversion modeling, we will quantify and apportion CH4 and N2O emissions to their sources with the goal of improving understanding of the driving processes and their respective control techniques. By working across scales, we will provide an integrated regional emissions estimate with sufficient detail to unambiguously quantify dairy livestock emissions as distinct from other greenhouse gas sources.

Competing signals of photosynthesis and respiration subject large-scale estimates of gross primary production to considerable uncertainty. The proposal at hand seeks to fill this critical knowledge gap by leveraging atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS) as a tracer for photosynthesis. Carbonyl sulfide is taken up by plants concurrently with CO2, but, whereas CO2 is also respired, COS is irreversibly transformed. As such, the magnitude of COS uptake over land can serve as a proxy for gross primary production. In order to accomplish this, I propose to modify the Sulfur Transport Eulerian Model (STEM) to model the transport and photosynthetic drawdown of COS over the Amazon basin. This approach has been successfully applied over North America and, with recent large-scale COS data collection campaigns beginning in the Amazon, now is an ideal time to apply the method to the tropics. These data will be used in the inverse component of STEM to better constrain surface fluxes. In addition to being optimally timed for data collection, the proposed research can also inform and use results from the ongoing Accelerated Climate Model for Energy project to which LLNL is a large contributor. The ACME model can be used to provide dynamic boundary conditions for regional-scale simulations, while results from STEM can provide high-resolution information about plant-related surface fluxes, consistent with ACME’s focus on biogeochemical and water cycles. Further work in both models is also needed to accurately model oceanic emissions of COS. Harnessing these models in tandem will allow for better understanding of the transport of COS and, by proxy, atmosphere-biosphere CO2 interactions. These results could be further incorporated into diagnostics like those in the International Land Benchmarking (ILAMB) Project to provide a metric for GPP suitable for model intercomparison.

However, it is uncertain how regional hydroclimate will be affected by climate change due to the short instrumental record and the paucity of paleoclimate records from the region. We propose to utilize geochemical variations in speleothems (cave calcite deposits) collected from NE Mexico, which span the last ~60,000 years, to investigate the timing and mechanisms of past hydrologic change over a range of timescales. Speleothems are unique paleoclimate archives in that they contain multiple climate proxies, can be precisely dated with U-series methods, and can cover seasonal to orbital timescales. The isotopic and elemental composition of speleothem calcite are widely utilized as paleoclimate proxies. However, interpretation is often complicated since multiple processes, from atmospheric to within cave, can influence the geochemical signal. Through collaboration with Dr. Peter Weber, we aim to integrate our long-term speleothem stable isotope and trace element (TE) data collected at UC Irvine, with high-resolution measurements conducted with the NanoSIMS instrument at LLNL, with the goals of improving our understanding of TE incorporation in speleothem calcite, identifying annual lamina for age model constraints, and testing for proxy evidence of extreme hydrologic events, such as droughts and hurricanes. NanoSIMS will allow us to spatially map TEs in key intervals to determine if they are uniformly distributed in calcite or associated with impurities, which has implications for their use as paleo-proxies. The high resolution of SIMS will also allow us to track seasonal changes in speleothem geochemistry, which may reveal annual cycles that could be utilized for age control, as well as for seasonal resolution paleoclimate reconstruction.

SPEs are essential for the development of quantum encryption devices, as well as fundamental investigations into quantum mechanical phenomena. In the past decade, several different systems have shown promise as SPEs including defects in diamond, hexagonal boron nitride and several different 2D materials. In addition to the defect-based emitters, quantum dots (QDs) have shown promise as strong SPEs at low temperatures. QD emitters are considerably easier to fabricate and achieve precise placement than defect-based emitters but so far have only worked at cryogenic temperatures. In collaboration with LLNL, we propose to investigate organo-metallic hybrid perovskite QDs as SPEs with the goal of stabilizing their emission through chemical, electromagnetic and plasmonic tuning to make a room temperature SPE. By collaborating with Dr. Ted Laurence at LLNL for his spectroscopy expertise, I hope to gain more insight into advanced time-resolved spectroscopies, such as photon correlation Fourier Spectroscopy techniques, that will measure the quality of our SPEs. We have previously shown that we can chemically tune our QD emission characteristics by changing the ligands that functionalize their surface. In collaborating with LLNL and with Dr. Tiziana Bond, specifically for her expertise in photonic materials as well as in modeling and fabricating plasmonic structures, we hope to use plasmonic structures to increase the SPE emission and tune their spectral properties via plasmonic coupling. LLNL fabrication capabilities with electron beam lithography and gold deposition and their Transmission Electron Microscope for structure characterization will also be of great assistance.

Numerical methods, especially Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), are playing an increasingly crucial role in their investigation. However, despite much progress, QMC remains computationally expensive; hence algorithm development remains a forefront problem in the evolution of the field. Langevin-based algorithms are key prospects for a breakthrough as they offer the possibility of improving the scaling of QMC from cubic to linear in the number of electrons. Although widely successful in lattice gauge theory (LGT), Langevin methods are less established in condensed matter physics, and have only recently been applied to simulating electron-phonon interactions. Working with Staff Scientist Kipton Barros at LANL, UC Davis Professor Richard Scalettar’s graduate student Benjamin Cohen-Stead will build on this initial success. The proposed research will have two broad foci. First, Ben will work on further improving the effectiveness of Langevin methods as applied to electron-phonon systems by investigating algorithmic improvements, including machine-learned preconditioners that reduce the number of matrix-vector multiplications needed in simulations, developing better estimators for physical observables, and using GPU units to accelerate the core linear algebra operations. Second, he will apply these newly developed Langevin methods to simulating interacting electron-phonon systems that were previously intractable, with the promise of uncovering novel emergent physics. One key objective will be the first large-scale, low temperature calculation of the phase diagram of a model which combines electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions. By collaborating with Kipton Barros at LANL, Ben will be able to benefit from his mentors’ complementary expertise in quantum simulations techniques, while developing dynamic codes capable of exploiting the substantial computing resources at LANL.

This proposal would leverage multi-disciplinary expertise at UC Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, and San Diego (and collaborators) to address the need for integrated coastal resilience research and targeted policy development by improving the understanding of coastal impacts and adaptation solutions (e.g., coastal defense, managed retreat, or insurance mechanisms) from the physical, ecological, and socio-economic perspectives.

From the heat of supernovae to ultracold atoms and from gravitational waves to the wave function of a single photon, experiments reaching higher degrees of control of photon sources beyond previously accessible parameters have revealed fundamental facts about the universe from the smallest to the largest scales. One commonality amongst these phenomena is the necessity of well-crafted control over photonic and electronic wavepackets to either drive processes in matter or conduct (quantum) measurements and computation with unprecedented precision in both time and space at fundamental atomic scales. At the intersection between photon and free electrons, intriguing physics in quantum electrodynamics (QED) presents new opportunities to upend the paradigm of X-ray science and engineering and circumvent traditional cost-accessibility tradeoffs in basic sciences, and commercial and medical applications. Emerging QED theory has revived interest in studying new X-ray production regimes, namely quantum X-ray emission, promising to unveil new quantum physical phenomena relevant in life and energy sciences, quantum computation, and metrology. Technologically, quantum X-ray emission can enable a dramatic cost reduction and portability of integrated (on-chip) X-ray sources to affect their application and upend their limited accessibility.

There is also growing evidence that youth, teachers, and schools are critical to the climate change movement.

The following two questions will guide our research activities: (1) What framework and principles effectively guide the design and facilitation of justice-centered community-engagement activities for youth? (2) What types of partnerships result in actionable outcomes that can effectively promote climate justice?

Their transformative potential comes with the risk of replicating an all-too-familiar problem: entrenching a particular language variety and language user, thereby raising barriers of access to services, education, and the workforce. The proposed MRPI builds upon an existing network of researchers in California to develop a solution-oriented assessment of how linguistic and neurocognitive diversity can be best incorporated into the design of LLMs for more equitable use. LLMs are very large statistical models trained on trillions of words and implemented with many thousands more parameters than traditional models. They are capable of producing a wide variety of styles of language, including dialogues (like ChatGPT), in a convincingly human-like way. Nonetheless, training data for these models draw disproportionately on texts produced in perceived standard varieties of English, by neurotypical, monolingual speakers with high educational attainment (Cai et al, 2024). We hypothesize that responses generated by LLMs fail to address the needs of users who don't fall as squarely in those categories, in terms of both content-generation and ease of use (Dwivedi et al, 2024). Our team proposes to explore how severe the misalignment is between user background/needs and how it can be mitigated. In doing so it aims to better match the powerful new generation of AI tools with the linguistically and socially diverse population of California. Our team will develop tools to assess gaps in the usability of systems built on LLMs and to minimize potential harms. The project has three primary strands: 1) experimental pilots employing psycholinguistic methods to identify gaps in user experiences with LLM content, assessing how these gaps might decrease accessibility to services, 2) four technical workshops (2 in-person, 2 virtual) introducing UC students and researchers to LLMs and the linguistic diversity of California, 3) a set of online, modular resources to expand graduate/undergraduate curricula, with datasets, scripts, and analyses, to be use in courses or training events across UC.

At the same time, there is insufficient evidence to guide management and treatment of pregnant individuals, due to their historic exclusion from clinical trials. An alternative to the clinical trial for evidence generation is the utilization of real-world evidence (RWE), defined as evidence derived from non-trial data sources. Pregnancy-related RWE generation has traditionally been limited to single institutions, which lack sufficient sample size, or administrative databases, which lack clinical detail. As a result, the ability to advance clinical knowledge based on currently available RWE is limited, particularly when comparing variations in care and resultant outcomes among specific subpopulations.

First, we plan to establish a central clinical data repository for all pregnancies and livebirths that occur within the four centers through a collaborative clinical, informatics, and data science effort that will harmonize pregnancy-related electronic health record data.

The standard method for multiplying two nxn matrices requires a number of operations of cubic order in n, which takes a long time to perform for large matrices. In 1969, Volker Strassen shocked the world by discovering a way to multiply 2x2 matrices using only 7 multiplications instead of the usual 8, which led to the first sub-cubic time algorithm for multiplying square matrices of all sizes. Since then, researchers have found increasingly ingenious methods for multiplying larger matrices faster than the standard approach. However, most of these methods remain purely theoretical and not practically implementable because, unlike Strassen's, they are not based on small-size matrix multiplication. This project aims to supercharge the search for new, faster, easy-to-implement matrix multiplication algorithms using a three-pronged approach: We will use powerful optimization tools such as SAT solvers to search for special tensors and their so-called `flattenings' (matrix triples) that provide the blueprint for new multiplication algorithms. We will harness the power of artificial intelligence to guide the search for promising new tensors that enable faster multiplication. We will utilize random walks on flip graphs - networks that encode relationships between fast matrix multiplication algorithms. Navigating these networks in clever ways can lead us to discover new, faster methods. The faster matrix multiplication algorithms we aim to discover could dramatically accelerate computations across the sciences and technology. In an age of big data, this acceleration is becoming ever more critical. Multiplying huge matrices is a key bottleneck in machine learning, data mining, physics simulations and more.

Given the physiology of their bodies, children, in particular, are more sensitive to heat stress than adults. Exposure to heat can have negative effects on children including dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, and heat stroke, as well as adverse effects on cognitive performance. Nearly six million children are enrolled in California’s public schools. As California experiences increasing heat due to climate change, a key question is whether the state’s schools and public health officials are ready to protect children from heat effects. This project will evaluate the vulnerability of California school-aged children to extreme heat, and will work with school and public health end-users to develop action plans to mitigate this threat. To address this issue, we will meet several key outcomes. First, we will use multiple data sources to compile a database of observed and predicted heat exposure in public schools that will be communicated with end-users and made publicly available via a data dashboard. We will assess heat observations and projections for a sample of 9 public schools within Santa Barbara County, Orange County, and Yolo County. Second, we will assess vulnerability and adaptation to heat exposure in the sample of public schools within these counties. Using a mixed methods approach, and considering multiple metrics, we will investigate vulnerability and adaptation to heat among a sample of public schools in these counties. We will also engage in primary data collection to assess heat health literacy among families, school personnel, and public health end-users. Lastly, we will engage community end-users working in schools, and public health administrators focused on children, youth, and health, in this research. We will identify end-user needs and priorities in the areas of heat exposures, vulnerabilities, and adaptations in these counties, and will provide these end-users with the capacity to develop decision making tools and action plans to meet their needs and priorities in these areas.

Despite a high mortality rate of 16% in our state, translating to over 47,000 deaths, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer a beacon of hope. The COMPOSER model, developed by UC San Diego researchers and published in Nature Digital Medicine, has shown a promising 17% reduction in mortality. The COMPOSER model utilizes predictive analytics algorithms to analyze real-time data from electronic health records, assessing over 150 patient variables to detect early signs of sepsis. Its deployment in emergency departments has led to not only a reduction in mortality but also improved adherence to protocolized care. The overarching goal of this project is the statewide implementation of the COMPOSER model to enhance early sepsis prediction and improve patient outcomes across California's healthcare system, with an estimated 8,000 lives saved per year. However, as with most technologies, this potential must be balanced by identifying and mitigating possible risks for patient harm and the propagation of healthcare disparities. Our initiative will focus on external validation of the COMPOSER AI model at UC Irvine, UCLA and their affiliated community hospitals, by 1) identifying barriers to AI model deployment, including interoperability standards, data privacy, algorithmic transparency and bias, and provider and patient trust, 2) validating the model’s performance across diverse patient cohorts and healthcare settings, and 3) implementing a privacy-preserving federated learning platform to iteratively improve model performance based on end-user feedback. This comprehensive framework for employing clinical AI solutions will engage a diverse cross section of stakeholders to foster a robust and reliable AI ecosystem that can be scaled to benefit the entire state. Our interdisciplinary team, comprising experts in critical care, biomedical informatics, and privacy, will address the challenges of AI deployment, including patient privacy, consent, and unbiased implementation.

The estimated lifetime social cost is 3.6 million per patient. Individuals affected with ASD can be challenged at work because of their difficulty to balance multitasking and focus. Additionally, challenges with communication and repetitive or inflexible behaviors often result in unemployment and isolation. The neurobiology of ASD remains unresolved. Animal models indicate alterations in the development, activity and plasticity of neural circuits. These processes can be studied in a human cellular context using neurons differentiated from human stem cells, including from patients. 2D neuronal cultures often oversimplify disease mechanisms and lack the complexity of organs. By contrast, brain organoids self-organize into 3D structures, represent fetal-like maturity and often more accurately model neurodevelopmental diseases. We will employ human brain organoids to study ASD mechanisms. Hundreds of ASD mutations have been identified. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations drive disease remain unclear. Here, we will uncover molecular, cellular, and developmental phenotypes driven by ASD-related mutations using brain organoids generated from ASD patient-derived cells as well as from ASD-gene CRISPR knockout cell lines from those same patient mutations. We will uncover the disease pathways through which ASD mutations act by analyzing neuronal differentiation and development, gene expression patterns, neuron structure and function, and neuronal activity. We will establish clinical relevance of disease mechanisms by relating them to patient brain imaging and clinical data. Understanding the pathways through which these ASD mutations cause disease will uncover new drug targets that can be pursued for ASD treatment and symptom relief. Our studies are significant because we will use patient-derived 3D disease models that represent human neurodevelopment, and we will assign clinical relevance to disease phenotypes discovered in a dish using the same patient’s imaging and clinical data.

Unrelenting water scarcity in many regions worldwide, including California and many regions in the United States, poses a formidable challenge to agriculture, which accounts for 50-90% of water use. The product of wastewater treatment plants can become an increasingly valuable nontraditional and sustainable water resource for irrigation. One important challenge is ensuring the high quality and quantity of agricultural products in light of chemical and microbial contaminants that may be present in recycled wastewater. Conventionally treated wastewater effluent contains a variety of contaminants including per-and poly-fluorinated Chemicals (PFAS), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and pathogens that are heavily impacted by human activities. These recycled water derived contaminants substantially reduces plant growth and crop yield during recycled water irrigation. This project will: (1) Develop novel water treatment technologies to degrade chemical and microbial contaminants from recycled irrigation water, and evaluate their fate and transport in crops in the water-food nexus; (2) Develop water deficit irrigation management strategies to enhance water conservation and food production; (3) Evaluate soil health and microbial ecosystem adaptation in response to recycled water irrigation; (4) Develop novel on-farm implementable management practices (i.e., targeted crop use) to minimize the transfer of contaminants to food crops after recycled water irrigation.

Such adversities can have long-lasting mental and physical health impacts, but many people can maintain considerable resilience and thrive in the face of adversity. Numerous UC researchers in Health Psychology, which studies how psychosocial factors influence physical health (and vice versa), are actively studying the health impact of adversity, and the psychosocial and cultural factors that contribute to resilience. The first UC Intercampus Consortium on Health Psychology meeting took place in 1983, followed by several meetings over 30 years (the last in 2003), sponsored by UC system, departmental, extramural, and individual funding. The conferences provided around 75 faculty and graduate students opportunities to network and forge new collaborations. This proposal aims to revive the Consortium after a decade-long dormancy, with the broad goal of making UC the world leader in research on understanding, predicting, and cultivating resilience in the face of adversity. To accomplish that goal we propose three activities and associated outcomes: 1) Facilitating cross-campus faculty collaborations. MRPI funding would support seed funding for multi-campus projects that translate basic research on thriving in the face of adversity into interventions that promote resilience. Outcomes would include scholarly products (books, new measures and interventions), and extramural research funding applications. Most projects would involve collaborations outside psychology (e.g., biomedical research, sociology, public health). 2) Creating shared resources for graduate student training and research. MRPI funding would support: Annual workshops to learn emerging research methodologies and data analytic techniques; Developing shared teaching resources across campuses (e.g., a digital video lecture library); and pilot funding for cross-campus student collaborations. 3) Reviving yearly intercampus conferences as a central organizing event.

Concepts of locality and neighborhood, civic inclusion and stakeholder participation are integral to this process.

Modern treatment of many cancers, genetic diseases, and other conditions utilize knowledge of the genetic alterations of the patient to choose pharmaceutical agents that best treat that patient: “Personalized Medicine”. Hundreds of treatments have been developed. In order to improve these treatments, researchers compare the results of different treatments for similar genetic alterations with the length of time patients remain disease free. The UC system maintains the UC Clinical Data Warehouse with over 5 million UC patients which provides the disease free period following treatment. However the genomic and genetic data is deficient. This is because treating physicians provides genetic testing results in a form that cannot be retrieved by researchers or they only provide partial information like the name of one or more altered genes and not the DNA sequence change. This is in part because companies that do the genetic and genomic testing do not provide reports in a computer-searchable format. In our project we will ask all major genetic testing companies used by UC physicians to provide the entire genetic testing results of all patients they have ever tested for UCI, UCSD, and UCLA. This information is to be provided in a “searchable” form. This information will be added to the UC Clinical Data Warehouse entries for the corresponding patients. Administrators and researchers with IRB approval of the UC system will then be able to determine compare treatments with the patients’ survival data for thousands of patients, will be able to determine whether results vary by campus, which treatment is best and answer many other questions.

MEG is a non-invasive neural imaging technique that directly measures the magnetic signal due to neuronal activation with high temporal resolution and spatial localization accuracy. MEG has been routinely used in localizing seizure foci in patients with epilepsy and for pre-surgical localization of brain functions. Recently, members of our team have showed that MEG can potentially be a powerful research and diagnostic tool for autism, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The magnetic field sensors used for commercial MEG systems are based on Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUID). SQUID-based sensors have the highest combination of sensitivity and bandwidth of any sensor known, but require costly and cumbersome refrigeration for cooling to cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K). The design and materials for these sensors have not changed in nearly three decades and there has been little progress in MEG hardware. The high cost has hindered widespread use of MEG at the clinical level and there are only about 30 of these systems in the United States (two are in the UC system at UCSD and UCSF). We propose to reinvent SQUID MEG, to make it affordable, and easier to use while at the same time improving the sensitivity and resolution. Our approach uses technologies that were not available 30 years ago when SQUID development stalled. A recent breakthrough was made by members of our team in developing a new type of high temperature superconductor (HTS) SQUID by modifying the ceramic material on the nanoscale using a finely focused beam of helium ions. This results in sensors with very low magnetic flux noise. Furthermore, unlike prior HTS technologies our new technique is relatively simple, inexpensive, high yield, and scalable to wafers for large scale sensor production. The goal of our proposed development will be to optimize the sensors and to construct prototype biomedical imaging instruments. The sensors in our instruments can be placed much closer to the scalp for greater spatial resolution and sensitivity because they function at higher temperature. Additionally we will improve the ease of use and significantly reduce the costs associated with acquisition and maintenance.

Experts predict that the pandemic will trigger widespread increases in mental health problems, but little data is available to test these predictions. To fill this gap, we turn to tracking internet searches on Google, where the content of a query reflects a mental health problem and their volume reflects the community prevalence. We previously found that internet searches for severe acute anxiety (“panic attack”) reached new all-time highs following the outbreak. That study was lauded for being the first to empirically assess how population mental health was potentially impacted by COVID-19 and discuss severe acute anxiety, an outcome overlooked in many opinion pieces on COVID-19’s mental health impacts. Extending that work, we will compile thousands of unique queries indicative of mental health problems, mine these trends to (Aim 1) discover the subset with the largest post-outbreak increases, thereby identifying and prioritizing the potential mental health problems impacted by COVID-19; and (Aim 2) discover the subset of queries that mirror past survey-based population prevalence of severe psychological distress (SPD) and use those queries to forecast the prevalence of SPD post COVID-19 when survey data are unavailable. Both aims represent the state-of-the-art in using searches for data driven insights (as in Aim 1) and using searches as a proxy for traditional survey-based trends (as in Aim 2). Our study will be the first application of either to mental health outcomes.

These issues are rooted in historic land management practices that negatively impact soil health, diminish soil carbon stores, contribute to poor air quality, and allow chemicals to leach into waterways and groundwater tables. These impacts weaken farm resiliency to the impacts of climate change and negatively affect farmworker and community health, safety and well-being. Alternately, research suggests that regenerative farming practices can reduce soil disturbance, increase soil organic matter, improve water-holding capacity, reduce petrochemical crop inputs, enhance soil biological function and microbial diversity, and support soil carbon accrual. The proposed multi-sector, multi-disciplinary project addresses these issues through applied on-farm research, remote sensing modeling technologies, and professional workforce development. Three activities are proposed: 1) The Soil Carbon Accrual Project is designed to holistically compare carbon cycling associated with the standard or conventional farming system (full tillage; herbicide; fertilizers; pesticides; no cover) to a regenerative farming system (cover crops; no-till or conservation till; crop rotations) using Eddy Covariance tower technology and soil microbiological DNA probes to quantify the impacts on soil carbon accrual, soil microbial diversity, water use efficiency, nutrient density, and economic return. 2) The California Resiliency Index uses sustainability factors (e.g., water resources; soil quality; water use; erodibility factors; groundwater recharge value; existing land uses; wildlife habitat potential; endangered species habitat) to predict long-term resiliency for agricultural regions and suitability for diversified farming systems within the State. The model is being collaboratively developed with the Chico State Geographical Information Center. 3) The online Technical Assistance Provider Training and Professional Certificate Program in Climate Smart/Regenerative Agriculture Practices & Implementation is designed to increase the availability of technical assistance to support rapid transition of California farms and ranches to climate-smart agricultural practices.

Climate change threatens California’s marine resources through sea level rise, ocean acidification, extreme weather events, ocean warming, and other effects. Despite the vulnerability of these resources and their importance to local communities and California as a whole (through tourism, fishing opportunities and the general benefits of a healthy marine system) fisheries of the far North Coast are patchily monitored due to lack of funding and the area’s isolated nature. Development of fisheries research and monitoring capability will provide crucial information on fish species and communities, which will lead to better-informed management of Tribal and State natural resources in the face of climate change. To improve the climate-resilience of far northern California fisheries, we propose to develop a working group of Tribal, university, state, and federal personnel to carry out fisheries research on species designated as priorities by the Tribes, based on the species’ cultural, ecological, and/or economic importance. These are generally high-use and/or low-information/data-limited fisheries species that inhabit oceanic coasts, estuaries and bays in Humboldt and Del Norte counties.

These biodiverse habitats span 25% of California (CA) and serve as the foundation for the ranching economy. CA grasslands are a biodiversity hotspot and globally unique, but climate change will make it unsuitable for endemic species; so we must innovate restoration that focuses on climate resilience. Yet a key issue remains of how to optimize trade-offs in achieving immediate outcomes vs. restoring climate resilient, species-rich communities. Most restoration practices favor common and easily cultivated species, which can risk biotic homogenization; one response could be to use climate-adapted sourcing from wider areas to bolster success. We propose integrating social, field and greenhouse methods to create a Climate-smart Restoration Toolbox to assist in drought resilient plant selection and site assessment. Our project will increase access to the best available science for restoring coastal CA grassland, inform nature-based solutions, strengthen climate resiliency, and leverage existing resources from Point Blue Conservation Science, Bureau of Land Management, and multiple grassland restoration agencies. Our objectives across three projects are: 1. Promote biodiverse restoration by initiating a CA Grassland Restoration Network for resource and seed sharing 2. Expand trait-based restoration by creating a toolbox for climate-smart grassland restoration, including protocols for site assessment and plant selection informed by site characterizations, greenhouse studies and practitioner surveys 3. Explore trade-offs in plant development with greenhouse drought studies using common and “uncharacterized” CA plants important for the Wiyot tribe. End-products will be manuscripts, student training, MS theses, a toolbox for climate-smart grassland restoration and a restoration network to promote collaborations and resource sharing to foster climate resilient grasslands.

Approximately 26 million acres of California is farmland and CSA can sequester 25-60 tons of carbon per acre, so the rapid adoption of these practices is crucial for the state to meet its aggressive targets for natural sequestration (AB 1757). The agricultural community has always been at the mercy of the elements, and is now on the front lines facing climate impacts. However, in addition to climate benefits, CSA typically increases productivity and has been shown to increase economic yield by up to 78%. Thus, for an agricultural center like the Central Coast of California, CSA provides a bulwark for economic resilience in addition to climate resilience. The Sustainable Land Initiative (SLI) is a program of the US-LT RCD in partnership with Cal Poly, to (a) help local farmers overcome impediments to the adoption of CSA practices aimed at sequestering carbon, reducing water consumption, decreasing fertilizer use/runoff, increasing economic yield, and making farms more resilient to climate change, and (b) implement precise quantitative monitoring of the effectiveness of these practices. Practices include application of biochar, cover crops, compost and use of no-till drills, keyline plows, and waterjet stingers. Impediments to be overcome include lack of strategy, funds, expertise, equipment, and labor. There is broad consensus that CSA supports climate objectives, but also that quantification of benefits varies widely across biomes, crops, and climate zones; accurate data are crucial and in short supply. Hence, the SLI includes a monitoring phase to generate precise data on the efficacy of CSA on local agriculture and provide an economic argument for adoption. This proposal seeks funding to launch the SLI, support regional SLI activity, and scale via other RCDs and campuses statewide.

The statistics for are astounding. Almost 160,000 Americans and 12,000 Californians die from lung cancer each year and, within five years of diagnosis, 82% of patients pass away. The link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer is well established and almost all lung cancer cases result from tobacco use. Unfortunately, most lung cancer diagnoses are not treatable by surgery, so chemotherapy has remained the preferred method of treatment. Therefore, it is critical to provide rapid and cost-effective access to lung cancer medications. Vinblastine and vincristine are two frontline anti-cancer therapeutics used to treat multiple cancers, including lung cancer. The industrial production of both of these drugs still relies on isolation from their natural plant source via an expensive and source-dependent process. Thus, vinblastine and vincristine remain some of the most expensive small molecule, off-patent chemotherapeutics on the market. Vinblastine and vincristine could be affordable with an efficient method of production; however, a viable alternative has not been developed. Toward the development of a new and efficient means to access vinblastine and vincristine, I propose to prepare secologanin and strictosidine.

Once people are diagnosed with lung cancer, they have approximately 50% chance of survival within the next five years. Although there are drugs available to treat lung cancer, such as chemotherapy and target treatment, there is still a chance the treatment will not work. To develop more precise and accurate treatment options, we need to better understand genetically what is causing drug resistance. Specifically, how do cancer cells interact with other types of cells in the lung to continue growth and evade drugs? Current studies show that cancer cells interact with surrounding immune cells to turn off their functions, so specific immune cells will not attack the cancer cells. Within the suite of immune cells, some are activated when they are assisting cancer cells and dormant otherwise. There are also many more cell types surrounding the cancer cells, such as blood and connective tissue cells, that also exist in different activated states. We hypothesize that all the surrounding cells in their various states communicate with each other to assist cancer cells with growth. To test this, we obtained data containing measurements of genetic activity in each cell type surrounding the lung cancer cells on a single cell level from a publicly available database. This allows us to peek into the genetic behavior of active and dormant cells from various cell types while they were present near cancer cells. With this data, we will first develop a machine learning algorithm to predict what communication interactions are occurring between the different states of cell types in lung cancer. This will provide insight into what cell behaviors are triggered in the different cell types.

Despite the relatively low incidence rate, it has the highest mortality rate among all the cancers. Of particular concern, pancreatic cancer is the only cancer with increasing mortality. Currently, only surgery remains the best chance of cure when detected early, as there are no therapies available to effectively treat this disease. To make condition even worse, even the early identified localized tumors are not operable in number of occasions. On the other end, patients who initially respond to the currently existing gold-standard chemotherapy, often develop resistance and do not respond to the treatment and die due to recurrent disease. These currently existing challenges requires the need for identification of therapeutic options that can efficiently cure this disease in advanced stage, or the development of techniques or tools that can detect this disease at a very early benign stage, along with the measures to prevent the progression of early stage disease to inoperable advanced stages. To offer one possible solution for treatment of pancreatic cancer, our lab proposes to target the “seed” of the cancer, i.e., the cancer stem cells by inhibiting proteins unique to such cells.

A common risk factor for these two cancers is cigarette smoking, which can account for ~80% of lung and ~30% of pancreatic cancers. Although most lung and pancreatic cancers are initially responsive to therapy, these tumors eventually stop responding, allowing them to grow and spread. In order to make tumors more sensitive to therapy and for the effects of therapy to remain effective for longer, it is critical to understand the molecular pathways cancer cells use to evade the effects of therapy. My project focuses on a protein located on the surface of some cancer cells named lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4 (LPAR4). Lung and pancreatic cancer patients with high levels of LPAR4 show shorter survival compared with patients who have low LPAR4 levels. Interestingly, LPAR4 is only detected when the cancer cells are challenged by unfavorable growth conditions, such as poor access to nutrients or treatment with cancer therapy. Once cancer cells gain LPAR4, they become more aggressive, more likely to spread or metastasize, and they are able to ignore the effects of therapy. These findings suggest that targeting LPAR4 might represent a new way to sensitize lung and pancreatic cancers to the effects of therapy. The first goal of my project is to better define how LPAR4 contributes to lung and pancreatic cancer progression. To do this, I will ask how cancer cells turn on LPAR4 as a way to cope with stress, and I will investigate how they take advantage of LPAR4 to become drug resistant. My second goal is to develop and test new anti-cancer strategies targeting LPAR4 as a new way to halt tumor progression and sensitize tumor cells to the effects of therapy.

Focus on the QT Interval,University of California Office of the President,https://ror.org/00dmfq477,ROR,https://ror.org/,,Other,Grant,"The risk of sudden death from tobacco cigarette (TC) smoking is largely independent of smoking burden, and reverts to that of a non-smoker soon after smoking cessation. These observations have led to the hypothesis that smoking-related sudden death is a direct toxic effect of constituent(s) in TC smoke, rather than a consequence of progressive coronary artery disease. Although controversial, electronic cigarettes (ECs) are perceived by many as a safer alternative to lethal TCs. Toxic constituents in EC emissions are orders of magnitude lower than in TC smoke – that is, except for nicotine; comparable plasma nicotine levels are achievable in EC users and TC smokers. Mechanisms of sudden death from smoking TCs are uncertain, but TCs are known to increase adrenaline levels and to change how electrical impulses are conducted in the heart – both risk factors for ventricular arrhythmias. Importantly, in single heart cells, nicotine has been shown to directly alter the electrical impulses in a way that could potentially lead to abnormal heart rhythms. These changes can be detected on the ECG in humans by measuring a segment called the ""QT interval."" TC smokers are reported to have prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG, indicative of abnormal electrical conduction, and a risk factor for sudden death. In studies in mice, exposure to emissions from ECs have also been reported to significantly increase the QT interval. Interestingly, in this rodent model, QT prolongation was triggered by the solvents in EC emissions, in the absence of nicotine. It is unknown if chronic EC users, like chronic TC smokers, have abnormal electrical conduction. Further, if present, it is unknown if abnormal electrical conduction is attributable to the nicotine, or the non-nicotine constituents in EC emissions. Our central hypothesis is that EC use is associated with abnormal electrical conduction in the heart detectable on the ECG, and that this effect is mediated by the nicotine, not non-nicotine constituents in EC emissions. This hypothesis will be tested in humans using a rigorous crossover design, including ECs with nicotine and without nicotine, and the nicotine inhaler. EC-mediated QT prolongation in humans, if present, is a potential game changer. It would be expected to significantly influence regulations of ECs, and to alter the public’s perception that ECs are harmless.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Holly Middlekauff,,,,"University of California, Los Angeles",https://ror.org/046rm7j60,ROR,https://ror.org/,2019-04-01,Issued,,T29IP0319SC,award-number,,,,,,

The result is increased exposure of developing fetuses to potential harm not just from nicotine, but also from the flavorings in the inhaled vapors. Thus far, there has been little few systematic investigations on the potential adverse health effects of vaping. Our preliminary data in animals show that the effects of nicotine can have harmful effects to subsequent generations of offspring, even though they are never exposed to nicotine. In a well-established animal model, we exposed pregnant dams to nicotine, and found that not only did their offspring develop asthma at a significantly greater rate compared to controls who were naïve to nicotine, but the subsequent generation of offspring were at significantly increased risk as well, despite never having been exposed to nicotine at all. These data led us to wonder whether exposure to vaping via e-cigarettes (e-cigs) might produce the same adverse health effects as well. Here we propose to address questions that naturally arise from these provocative data: Can adverse effects of nicotine delivered by e-cigs impact subsequent generations? What is the role of flavorings in e-cigs? How do e-cigs impact the epigenome of germ cells (eggs and sperm)? How does that influence the development of lung cells (which differentiate from germ cells)? Are they normal, or abnormal? Our studies will address these questions using established models and experienced collaborators. Specifically, we propose to investigate whether vaping effects can be transmitted across generations, and determine the relative impact of inhaled nicotine and flavorings. Furthermore, we will determine the effects of vaping on germ cell viability and epigenetic memory. Our investigation will advance the understanding of how adverse effects of vaping are transmitted to future generations, and will not just inform public policy makers, but will arm them with objective evidence as they work to protect our society and our offspring from the harmful effects of vaping.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Virender Rehan,,,,Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center,https://ror.org/025j2nd68,ROR,https://ror.org/,2019-04-01,Issued,,T29IR0737HC,award-number,,,,,,

Unfortunately, lung cancer is not usually caught at this early stage, as small tumors such as these remain asymptomatic. Because of this, the survival rate for lung cancer as a whole is bleak. I am interested in developing new ways of detecting lung cancer earlier. An ideal early detection test would be (a) easily accessed by at-risk populations; (b) inexpensive; (c) accurate at detecting the presence of cancer; (d) noninvasive. All of us have short fragments of free-floating DNA in our bloodstreams that is released when cells naturally die and turn over. This DNA is referred to as cell-free DNA, or cfDNA. In a person who has cancer, some fraction of the total cfDNA originates from the tumor cells. Because tumors differ from healthy cells by the presence of mutations, tumor-derived cfDNA can be detected by looking for the presence of these mutations, and my lab has excelled at using these mutations to detect cancer noninvasively. In addition to mutations, tumor cells also differ from healthy cells in the ways they control their genes, a term that can be collectively called their 'epigenome.' The cell-free DNA epigenome has not been extensively studied as a biomarker for cancer early detection, and I am interested in developing a new method that uses the epigenome and mutations together to help detect lung cancers earlier.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Emily Hamilton,,,,Stanford University,https://ror.org/00f54p054,ROR,https://ror.org/,2019-09-01,Issued,,T30DT0806,award-number,,,,,,

In 2019, it is projected that 228,150 Americans will be diagnosed and 142,670 will die from lung cancer. Smoking is the most common risk factor for lung cancer, contributing to 80%-90% of lung cancer deaths. In 2013, the U.S. Preventative Task Force began recommending lung cancer screening for people at high risk, which has resulted in an earlier stage diagnosis for many tobacco users. However, disparities in who receives screening and appropriate treatment for lung cancer have been observed across different racial/ethnic groups, among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, and underserved rural populations. Favorable prognosis is highly dependent on a patient’s stage of diagnosis and receipt of proper treatment in a timely manner. California has a highly diverse population with more Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians than any other state, a combined nonwhite population that is the second highest of any state, and one of the highest poverty rates nationwide. The objective of this dissertation is to better understand the mechanisms of disparities in lung cancer patient’s receipt of proper treatment in California. Specifically, to identify factors that explain racial/ethnic disparities in receipt of proper care from three distinct domains: spatial proximity and accessibility of treatment facilities, racial composition and segregation of a patient’s neighborhood, and aspects of the patient-provider relationship within the healthcare system. Several population-based data sources will be used, including geocoded statewide cancer registry data linked with electronic health records from a large healthcare system in Northern California.

HSCs are responsible for the daily formation of all blood and immune cells, and are essential for life. The number of HSCs must be tightly controlled because too many can lead to cancer, and too few can cause bone marrow failure.

This technology has drastically increased the survival rates for cervical, breast, and testicular cancer patients among others. Despite these advancements, progress in our ability to treat lung cancer has remained stagnant, evidenced by a still dismal survival rate. Lung cancer is physiologically unique in that its genome is highly unstable, or in other words, it mutates its genes very quickly. Thus, it is difficult to leverage sequencing technology to pinpoint genes to therapeutically target, as mutated genes are rarely the same between patients. Moreover, while some mutated genes have been identified as recurring in small patient populations and have available therapies, patients often relapse after an initial period of remission. This is likely due to the ability of lung cancer to mutate rapidly and thus develop secondary growth and survival pathways. Therefore, it would be prudent to develop alternate strategies to target lung cancer outside of driver mutation-based therapies. Paradoxically, the rapid mutation rate that makes lung cancer hard to treat with modern drug development strategies makes it vulnerable to ‘old school’ drugs. For example, chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin have been the front-line therapy for the last 30 years. Cisplatin is genotoxic; it damages DNA in cells, and thereby kills them. Because the genome in lung cancer is unstable and thus has high levels of DNA-damage to begin with, its ability to buffer additional damage from cisplatin is impaired relative to healthy cells. However, cisplatin at therapeutic dosages still generates damage in healthy tissue, inducing side-effects such as toxicity in the kidneys. Selectively inducing DNA-damage in tumor cells by inhibiting cancer genes that prevent damage accumulation is an intriguing alternate strategy for treatment. Interestingly, a protein complex named INO80C is over-active in lung cancer, and acts to prevent DNA damage only in cancer-like conditions. We propose that inhibition of INO80C activity will selectively amplify cisplatin’s toxicity in lung cancer cells, enabling lower dosages that promote increased efficacy in killing cancer cells and decreased off-target toxicity in patients.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,MICHAEL KRONENBERG,,,,"University of California, Los Angeles",https://ror.org/046rm7j60,ROR,https://ror.org/,2019-09-01,Issued,,T30DT0906,award-number,,,,,,

By the time lung cancer is usually detected, the patient presents with a late-stage diagnosis. Thus, screening in high-risk patients (such as smokers) to detect early stage lung cancer is sorely needed. Radiographic imaging can be used for screening, but they lack the ability to catch tumors early and do not provide any genetic information. Liquid biopsy, an emerging clinical approach, can solve this problem by non-invasively detecting lung cancer in bodily fluids by measuring circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fragments shed by tumor cells. We have developed a technology, electric field-induced release and measurement (EFIRM) liquid biopsy (eLB) which can reliably assess ctDNA of two major subtypes of lung cancer mutations using a small volume of blood. These two major subtypes, however, only provide coverage for 15% of lung cancer subtypes. Therefore, effort must be made to expand the number of detectable mutations and in particular, those associated with smoking such as mutations in a gene called KRAS. The difficulty with expanding targets detectable by eLB is that it requires true clinical samples containing ctDNA from cancer patients. Attempts to fabricate artificial ctDNA is a challenge. A major reason is because there is limited understanding of ctDNA biology in terms of its various traits. In this proposal we wish to achieve four objectives. Firstly, we wish to complete development of an eLB assay for smoking-associated KRAS mutations in ctDNA and test its efficacy on clinical samples. Secondly, we wish to describe the biological characteristics of the smoking-associated KRAS ctDNA targets that are detected by eLB in patient plasma samples. Thirdly, we wish to observe the similarity between the biology in ctDNA from clinical samples and cultured cells harboring the same smoking-associated KRAS mutations. Finally, we wish to attempt to use this cell culture to create a surrogate KRAS ctDNA model that can be used as standardized material for ctDNA detection development. The findings from this project will be essential for learning more about ctDNA and cancer biology and will aid in expanding EFIRM’s panel of ctDNA targets.

In order to achieve such growth, cancer cells need a higher than usual amount of proteins, the building blocks of all cells and life. Normally, protein production starts with the DNA, which contains the sequences of all proteins, which is copied into mRNA which is then translated into proteins by specialized structures called ribosomes. Because this process of translation is key in producing proteins, cancer cells try to hijack the ribosome and the rest of the translational machinery in order to alter which and how much proteins are produced. One component that is hijacked by cancer is a protein called DDX3, which in its normal function untangles mRNA to allow it to be translated. Because DDX3 only untangles specific mRNA structures, it affects only a specific subset of mRNAs and hence it can promote the production of only a subset of proteins. Different cancers, including cancers related to tobacco, take advantage of DDX3 in different ways to promote the production of different proteins, based on what is more useful to each cancer type. In order to be able to treat these tumors, we need a better understanding of DDX3 and what it does in order to counteract its activity. The research outlined in this proposal will investigate what makes up this subset of mRNAs and proteins and how increasing their production contributes to the spread of cancer. First, I will make different mRNA sequences and structures to determine which ones are being untangled by DDX3. Secondly, I will use a technique called ribosome profiling to determine which proteins are produced when DDX3 increases in cells exposed to tobacco. Finally, I will grow different cancer cells in the lab that have different amounts of DDX3 in order to investigate which cancers take advantage of DDX3. We will determine if they used the proteins that are produced thanks to DDX3 to move, grow, metastasize, and/or replicate. In conclusion, once this study will be over, we will know more about one mechanism that cancer uses to grow and spread, and we will be able to develop new drugs to stop cancer from employing DDX3 in such a way.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Kevin Wilkins,,,,"University of California, San Francisco",https://ror.org/043mz5j54,ROR,https://ror.org/,2019-09-01,Issued,,T30DT1004,award-number,,,,,,

The disruption of these mechanisms is often associated with the development of human diseases such as cancer. My proposal focuses on the concept that while DNA mutations can promote cancer, the accumulation of too many mutations in a cancer cell can be exploited to kill this cell. SCLC is an aggressive lung cancer, mainly caused by heavy smoking, and is driven by inactivating mutations in two key cell cycle genes, RB and p53. These mutations mostly affect the early steps of the cell cycle but are not readily ‘druggable’. Interestingly, however, drugs targeting late stages of the cell cycle progression have been recently developed. It has been proposed that disrupting these late cell cycle steps in cancer cells in which the early steps are already disrupted, may lead to catastrophic cell division and cell death. The cancer genome accumulates many mutations and if the cancer cell is unable to repair them before dividing, this may lead to cell death. Indeed, these drugs, including inhibitors of the WEE1 protein, involved in a late stage of cell division (mitosis), have shown promising results in SCLC patients; however, evidence of resistance to treatment has also already emerged from these studies. My project aims to elucidate the mechanisms that control how cells respond to WEE1 inhibition, why they sometimes become resistant to this inhibition, and how to resensitize them with combinational treatments. In brief, I have performed unbiased genome-wide screens in SCLC cells to identify genes whose loss of function may regulate how SCLC cells respond to WEE1 inhibition. From these screens, I have already uncovered candidate genes important for WEE1 inhibition resistance and sensitivity. I will use unique tools developed in the Sage lab, including mouse models, to identify additional candidates and validate top candidate genes involved in WEE1 resistance. I will also examine the role of these candidates at the single cell level, which allows to determine how key signaling pathways respond to specific genetic mutations in single cells within heterogeneous populations.

Epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that fetal nicotine exposure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in postnatal life. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the vascular wall, an enzyme called endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) can produce nitric oxide (NO) or superoxide anion (O2•–) depending on the bioavailability of its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). If the vasculature system is undergoing BH4 deficiency, then the eNOS uncouples, and the vasculature produces much more O2•– rather than NO. Endothelial derived NO induces vaso-relaxation while, in contrast, endothelial-derived O2•– promotes vascular constriction. Thus, when eNOS is in the uncoupling stage, it can cause vascular constriction leading to the development of a hypertensive phenotype. In this proposed project, we will employ a pregnant rat model with inhaled nicotine exposure. The offspring will be kept until the adult age of 6 months post prenatal inhaled nicotine (PIN) exposure. Their blood pressures (BP), vascular wall eNOS expressions, and other factors will be determined and compared between the control and PIN exposed groups. We expect that PIN exposure will attenuate the arterial DNA methyltransferase expression level leading to reprogrammed vascular eNOS protein levels, which will result in enhanced eNOS levels in the adult offspring. This progress will lead to eNOS uncoupling that produces less NO and more superoxide anion. Once this phenomenon occurs in their vascular walls, the offspring will develop a hypertensive phenotype in their adult life. Therefore, due to the enzyme eNOS in the vascular wall being epigenetically reprogrammed by nicotine exposure, the proposed study provides novel evidence that children who are prenatally exposed to nicotine have a higher risk of developing a hypertensive phenotype later in life.

Cigarette smoke contains 70 carcinogens, most of which are known mutagens and capable of activating oncogenes and inactivating tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, through genetic mutations. Indeed, TP53 is frequently mutated in breast cancer and the rate of p53 mutation is much higher in smokers that that in non-smokers. Thus, understanding the biology of p53 will help reveal the biological pathway that contributes to the pathology of breast cancer. Nerve injury-induced protein 2 (Ninj2), a cell adhesion molecule, is induced in response to nerve injury. Notably, Ninj2 expression is increased in breast cancer. However, it is not clear whether Ninj2 is involved in breast cancer development. To this end, we performed a pilot study and found that Ninj2 is activated by p53 and in turn represses p53 expression in breast cancer cells. We also found that loss of Ninj2 inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells carrying wild-type p53 but promotes the growth of cancer cells carrying a mutant p53. Thus, we hypothesize that the p53-Ninj2 loop plays a critical role in breast cancer development and progression. To test this, we will determine the mechanism by which p53 and Ninj2 are mutually regulated. We will also determine whether the p53-Ninj2 loop can explored as a therapeutic target for breast cancer carrying wild type p53. Successful completion of this project would further our understanding of the p53 biology and most importantly, lay a foundation for development of new therapeutics for breast cancer patients.

It has proven hard to disentangle and understand these changes because the total number of genetic changes and key genes is simply too large for standard approaches. It has also proven very hard to just glean this information from patient data alone - we desperately need scalable and faithful preclinical models. Here we will continue development of very promising mouse models of lung cancer, and specifically those lung cancers that are common among smokers, using the newest technologies such as barcoding and CRISPR that we named Tuba-seq. The key shortcoming of Tuba-seq now is fairly limited ability to generate sufficiently complex genotypes. Here we will use a new modification of the Tuba-seq to allow it to use CRISPR to simultaneously mutate pairs of genes, instead of just one, substantially increasing the scalability of this very promising technology and then carry out a study of how multiple key drivers of cancers interact with one another.

Although electronic cigarettes have been advertised as a healthier substitute to tobacco smoking, the aerosol of e-cigarettes still contains a wide range of deleterious products, such as nicotine. In regard to the dental health, cigarette smoking increases risks of orofacial clefts in infants, alveolar bone loss, periodontal disease, oral mucosa cancer and tooth decay. More recently research showed that among more than 1000 people, cigarette smokers were 1.7 times more likely than non-smokers to have root canal treatment (RCT) with 28 years follow up. During RCT, the dental pulp is removed, and the canal is disinfected, filled and sealed. However, there is little report on the biological changes in the dental pulp of the cigarette smokers, which leads to the increased RCT treatment. Dental pulp harbors a mixture of cells including dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells (DPSCs), which are critical in mediating dental pulp regeneration. The easy access and high proliferation rate also make DPSCs a valuable resource of personalized tissue regeneration in the future. Therefore, there is much value in preserving the vital dental pulp during dental treatment. Cigarette smoking has been reported to increase the death of stem cells and suppress the regeneration of the stem cells. In this study, we will investigate whether cigarette smoke extract and one of its major deleterious substances nicotine impair the regenerative capacities of human dental pulp stem cells, and make the dental pulp more susceptible to irreversible inflammation.

Immunotherapy is a new approach to cancer treatment that enhances the body’s immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells. T cells, a type of immune cell, play an important role in the human immune system’s ability to fight cancer and are increasingly being used in cancer immunotherapy. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered T cell therapy genetically reprograms a patient’s own T cells to specifically recognize and kill cancer cells. CAR-T cell therapy has led to dramatic clinical responses in B cell leukemia and lymphoma, and is currently under intensive investigation as a treatment for solid tumors, including lung cancer. A new approach to improving CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors is to use human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to generate optimized immune cells in the lab. hPSCs have the capacity to self-renew in the lab, and therefore can potentially be engineered to produce hPSC-derived immune cells with enhanced activity against certain cancers, and the ability to be used in any patients as “off-the-shelf” cell therapies. Our group has developed a novel culture system called the artificial thymic organoid (ATO) system that supports the generation of functional T cells from hPSCs in the lab. In addition to T cells, however, innate immune cells, including natural killer cells, have shown promise in cancer immunotherapy, with comparable anti-tumor efficacy and less toxicity than T cells in early lab studies. By modifying the ATO system, we have engineered hPSCs with a leukemia-targeting CAR, and induced their differentiation into CAR-expressing innate immune cells.

Cardiovascular disease and chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) are the leading cause of death in United States according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), yet the underlying details are poorly understood. How smoking exactly injures endothelial cells, the inner lining of blood vessels is poorly understood and requires further exploration. Smoking related endothelial dysfunction results in production of inflammatory molecules such as thrombin, reactive oxygen species, p38 that disrupt endothelial cell–cell tight junctions causing barrier permeability and vascular leakage that contribute to CVD. Several studies have shown increased levels of thrombin (even in minutes) in chronic smokers. Moreover, other studies showed that blood from active smokers, induced reactive oxygen species production through activation of the p38MAPK protein (a protein that can relay signals to the next protein), in endothelial cells through unknown mechanisms, suggesting a link between thrombin and p38 MAPK signaling. Our lab extensively works on PAR1 a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), known to regulate endothelial inflammatory responses that are linked to CVD. Previously we showed that thrombin-activated PAR1 is modified by ubiquitin (another protein) and recruits two other proteins TAB2 and TAB1 to turn-ON p38-dependent endothelial barrier disruption, a hallmark of inflammation. We hypothesize that smoke product-induced endothelial dysfunction results in altered p38 inflammatory signaling due to dysregulation of modulators that control PAR1 ubiquitination. We propose to identify molecular mechanisms of how PAR1 gets ubiquitinated and deubiquitinated which controls the p38 ON/OFF switch. Using advanced biochemical, microscopic techniques in cells and mice model system, this proposal will reveal how smoke products modulate PAR1-p38 inflammatory signaling in endothelial cells and identify new FDA approved drug targets for therapeutic development.

However, before a tumor develops into cancer, it needs to acquire not just one, but a handful of mutations sequentially. Evolutionary biology is the study of how mutations arise and spread in populations. A tumor is a population of cells, and there is no debate among scientists that cancer is an evolutionary process. Cancer-causing, so called ""driver"" mutations need to spread in the tumor to evolve into cancer. It has been previously impossible to follow and measure this process of spreading driver mutations in a tumor growing inside a body. I modified a state-of-the-art experimental technique developed at Stanford University to be able to exactly do that: quantify how different cancer driver mutations can spread in a tumor. I am using a mouse lung model to initiate tumor growth using a special virus that only causes cancer in this mouse strain. I then introduce known additional cancer driver mutations in some cells within the tumors using a second virus and the CRISPR genome editing technique. I simultaneously mark the cells with a ""DNA-barcode"" which enables me to measure via DNA sequencing if the acquisition of an extra driver mutation helped the cell to divide faster and outcompete its neighbors in the tumor. The outcome of my research will have two significant clinical implications. First, by measuring the potential to expand in an established tumor, I will be cataloging mutations based on a novel ""real-life"" property. This can help to identify mutations and the genes that are most closely linked to cancer development. Second, a recent realization in cancer research is that tumors are much more heterogenous than we previously imagined. Sequencing cells from different parts of a single tumor from the same patient showed very different mutations. The problem that this genetic heterogeneity poses is that even if just 1% of those cells are resistant to the therapy chosen by the oncologist, cancer can relapse after an initial remission. My research will hopefully make a big step towards understanding how genetic heterogeneity is generated and maintained inside a tumor.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Gabor Zoltan Boross,,,,Stanford University,https://ror.org/00f54p054,ROR,https://ror.org/,2020-07-01,Issued,,T31FT1772C,award-number,,,,,,

One potential reason for this disparity is that sexual minority individuals experience greater stress due–in part–to discrimination. It is important to better understand the reasons for this disparity in order to design better treatments for sexual minority smokers who want to quit. Another important risk factor for smoking and relapse during quit attempts is having a romantic partner who also smokes. However, most smoking cessation treatments are developed to treat the individual smoker. For example, immediate responses to stressors (such as feelings of anger or anxiety) are associated with smoking relapse in individual smokers who are trying to quit. Previous research has largely ignored the complex interpersonal dynamics that may alter stress response in smoking romantic partners, and even fewer studies have examined sexual minority couples who smoke. In this 35-day Ecological Momentary Assessment study we propose to address this important gap by investigating the mood and behavior of same-sex couples in which both partners smoke and are motivated to quit. Participants will complete phone surveys for 35 days on several measures that will allow us to examine the complex interplay between two types of stressors (discrimination stress and relationship stress), each partner’s mood and interpersonal behaviors, and smoking lapses and relapse during a smoking quit attempt. Specifically we will examine how discrimination and a partner’s negative interpersonal behaviors contribute to smoking relapse, and how a partner’s positive interpersonal behaviors (such as providing emotional support) can help counteract these stressful influences.

While SCLC represents only about 15% of lung cancer cases, it is the most aggressive and fatal form of lung cancer, with only 5-10% of SCLC patients estimated to survive beyond 5 years after initial diagnosis. Because of this, a major goal of the field is to identify key genes driving SCLC growth, spread (metastasis to other parts of the body), and response to treatment. By understanding the biology behind SCLC aggressiveness, our aim is to develop novel, improved targeted therapies to help SCLC patients in the clinic. Identifying key genes in SCLC, however, has proven very challenging. Indeed, nearly all SCLC patients are heavy smokers, and the DNA in their tumors is highly mutated from exposure to carcinogens in the tobacco smoke. This makes is difficult to distinguish gene mutations promoting cancer from non-important mutations occurring randomly due to these carcinogens. Another challenge is the lack of robust research pipeline to functionally validate which genes are important for SCLC growth. In particular, the field has developed accurate mouse models for SCLC, in which genetic manipulations in the lungs of mice can lead to the development of tumors that resemble very closely lung tumors seen in human SCLC patients. However, these mouse models can only test one candidate gene at a time in 2-3 years, which severely limits their utility for functionally validating candidate genes in SCLC. My work aims to fill these gaps by identifying top candidate genes using computational approaches and by testing a large number of these genes for their possible cancer-promoting functions in a new type of mouse model. Briefly, my first goal is to develop new genetic models in mice where I can mutate multiple candidate genes in the lungs of mice and quantitatively assess the contribution of each gene to SCLC growth. My second goal is to interrogate how these genes hijack normal biological processes to fuel SCLC growth. These approaches will save time and money to validate candidate genes playing an important role in SCLC while providing deeper insight into how these genes enact biological changes favoring tumor growth.

Smoking is a well-recognized risk factor for PDAC, accounting for 30% of the cases. The goal of our research is to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to the development of PDAC. Ultimately, this will lead to better prevention and treatment strategies for this cancer. In order to communicate with the environment, cells use receptors, which are located on the surface of the cell. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are one of the biggest family of receptors. GPCRs communicate with molecules within the cell such as the extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK), a master switch to control cell growth and survival. Due to its key role, ERK has the potential to convert healthy cells into cancerous cells. Smoking directly or indirectly activates disease-related GPCRs. On the other hand, pharmacological inhibitions of GPCRs halt the advancement of PDAC. Moreover, frequent mutations of GPCR in PDAC indicate the importance of these receptors. However, we are still missing many parts to the puzzle as we do not understand the precise mechanism and the different roles of all players. In our early study, we found the GPCR-mediated ERK activity occurs not on the cell surface where the receptors sit, but instead at the endosomes, vesicles for the trafficking of GPCRs from the cell surface into the cell. Strikingly, blocking this spatially controlled communication reduces the expression of a key cancer-causing gene and the growth of pancreatic cancer cells. These promising data have led to a hypothesis that GPCR-mediated ERK activation initiates at the endosomes and plays an important role in PDAC development via gene expression regulation. In this study, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism of the spatially controlled GPCR-stimulated ERK signaling and determine its functional roles in PDAC development and impart of tobacco use. We will employ cutting edge fluorescence technologies to study this signaling events in living cells.

A large body of literature suggests that Black individuals' smoking motives may be related to coping with psychological distress and difficulties stemming from their experiences with racism and racial trauma, as a means to self-mediate out of painful emotions. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recent anti-Black racial tragedies and violence across the U.S., there is emerging public health concern that this substance-related coping may be further exacerbated. Given that smoking is related to a host of long term health risks, exposure to racism, especially within the COVID-19 era, continues to be a serious social determinant that disproportionately increases risk of smoking among Black emerging adults and their long term health disparities.

These traumatic exposure to online racism has been found to be linked to a host of mental health issues and substance use risk. Controlling for offline racism, our preliminary cross-sectional data shows that online racism was significantly associated with more recent tobacco use (e.g., earlier today) and vaping use among Black emerging adults and these links were mediated by depression and anxiety associated with online racism. Accordingly, it is imperative to explore the tobacco product use risk associated with online racism and examine potential mechanisms using a longitudinal design to identify factors that can be addressed to mitigate early tobacco product use in this vulnerable group.

Our genes contain instructions (codes) for making proteins that do much of the work in our bodies, including transmitting signals to and from the brain. Only a small portion of genes actually code for proteins while the remaining “non-coding” region of genes is less well understood. Instead of focusing on the parts of our genes that provide instructions for making proteins, we are looking at non-coding regions that were previously overlooked. Using advanced tools, we identified a specific change in the genetic code related to nicotine addiction in youth, amplifying the desire for nicotine in both adolescent rodents and humans. This is particularly crucial as adolescence represents a critical period when the brain is uniquely vulnerable to the allure of addictive substances like nicotine. Unlike previous studies that concentrated on specific protein-coding areas of genes, we honed in on a specific genetic variation in a non-coding region. To better understand this, we created a special group of rats with a genetic change similar to what we observed in adolescent humans. This helps us bridge the gap between our animal models and human adolescents. Our main goal is to figure out how this genetic change influences behaviors related to adolescent nicotine use. We believe it might affect the signaling or other biological features of key areas of the adolescent brain associated with reward. By unraveling these connections, we hope to identify new proteins that play a role in adolescent addiction. Understanding how these genetic variations impact addiction, especially considering the rise in nicotine use among California youth, is crucial.

Prior research has shown screening to be a promising tool for reducing deaths from this deadly disease. Despite being recommended for nearly a decade, lung cancer screening remains uncommon among prior and current tobacco users. Across the U.S., only 6% of those who are eligible for lung cancer screening have received this potentially lifesaving test. The situation in California is even worse; only 1% of eligible California residents have received lung cancer screening, placing California in a tie with Wyoming for last place in the nation with regard to lung cancer screening. This important screening test is mostly accessible through academic medical centers, contributing to even lower uptake among racial/ethnic minority, low income, and immigrant residents who may not receive care in these settings. Few prior studies have focused specifically on population subgroups who may be at higher risk for lung cancer due to smoking history, or have historically worse lung cancer outcomes, but are less likely to be offered lung cancer screening. Therefore, we propose an academic-community partnered pilot study to gather data in diverse communities at elevated risk for poor lung cancer outcomes (Black, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Latinx, low-income white) in the preferred language of the participant. In each group, we will conduct a series of interviews with community members who are eligible for screening as well as with representatives of community organizations and clinics that serve these respective communities.

As new products and forms of administration for nicotine and cannabis have emerged, increasing co-use of multiple types tobacco use and of tobacco and cannabis among young adults has also been observed and is particularly concerning for the associated physical and mental health consequences. Yet, the factors leading to transition from electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) to other tobacco and co-use of two or more tobacco products, and ENDS and cannabis co-use remain poorly understood. Currently, there are no systems for monitoring the market introduction of emerging ENDS and cannabis vapes to assess their impact on use patterns. This study will adapt existing approaches in data science, quantitative, and qualitative research to develop a surveillance system of emerging ENDS and cannabis vapes to elucidate their impact on ENDS, tobacco, and cannabis use patterns. The objective of this proposal is to determine the effect of exposure to and engagement with ENDS and cannabis vapes on transitions from mono-ENDS use to other tobacco product and cannabis use. Surveillance of digital assets will be conducted to monitor the introduction of popular and emerging ENDS and cannabis vapes as they are digitally marketed during the study period (Specific Aim 1).

This complex disease is caused by the dysfunction or loss of pancreatic islet insulin-producing β cells. Cigarette smoking is a well-recognized risk factor for both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as it was associated with islet β cell damage and impaired insulin secretion. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smokers represent 20.8% of the US adult population and present a 30% to 40% higher risk to develop diabetes compared with non-smokers. In addition, children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy were up to four times more likely to develop diabetes later in life compared with children who were never exposed to nicotine during their embryonic development, suggesting that cigarette smoking may have an intergenerational impact on diabetes development. Yet, the effect of perinatal exposure on the development of the pancreas and its consequences on hyperglycemia are poorly understood. Our in vivo preliminary data shows rats exposed to nicotine during their embryonic development are born with impaired pancreas vasculature. These findings are associated with a decreased number of β cells, suggesting impaired angiogenesis and pancreas development processes in nicotine-exposed offspring.

In contrast, with recreational legalization, cannabis availability and use have increased and the prevalence of cannabis use in California is higher than the national average. Studies have raised concerns that co-use of cannabis can make it more difficult to quit tobacco. Unfortunately, few studies have focused specifically on co-use and little is known about how cannabis has impacted tobacco use behavior and the specific barriers that co-use creates for quitting. We used a national cohort of US adults to compare changes in tobacco and cannabis use from 2017 to 2021. We found that though overall tobacco use declined, co-use with cannabis showed small increases. As our study aimed to represent the general population, only a minority of the cohort used tobacco alone or with cannabis. Therefore, the sample was too small to determine how co-use impacted tobacco cessation. Similarly, though other longitudinal surveys capture data on cannabis and tobacco, none are specifically focused on co-use. They do not measure factors that will be critical to designing interventions, including specific aspects of motivation, what patients perceive as barriers to cessation, and among those who attempt to quit, reasons why they fail or relapse. In addition, cannabis use is diverse, and it is not clear whether any co-use interferes with cessation or whether there are specific patients at highest risk. Frequency of cannabis use, presence of cannabis use disorder, potency of cannabis used and reasons for cannabis use may all be risk factors for decreased and/or unsuccessful quit attempts We propose to recruit a diverse cohort of 2,800 US adults who currently use tobacco (cigarettes or vaping) and survey them in 2023, 2024, and 2025. We will collect detailed information on tobacco/cannabis use patterns. Recruiting only those who are already using tobacco will yield a much larger sample with the ability to study the impact of cannabis on motivation to quit tobacco, explore barriers to quitting tobacco, and examine reasons for relapse in detail.

Ninety percent of those who smoke tobacco initiate smoking before the age of 18, when the developing brain is most vulnerable. Forty to seventy percent of the tobacco use risk factors are heritable, but genetic studies of have been underpowered, limiting our ability to improve our biological understanding of tobacco use disorders (TUDs) and the identification of novel therapeutics and preventive mechanisms. Tobacco use is correlated with externalizing (EXT) behaviors (e.g., impulsivity, aggression), which have adverse impacts throughout the lifespan. The Externalizing Consortium has conducted the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) of EXT (N=1.5M), which identified >500 genetic risk loci. This study uncovered substantial genetic associations between EXT and tobacco use behaviors. However, the pathways whereby EXT affect tobacco use behaviors is largely unknown – including potential sex-specific effects and changes over time. This proposal will leverage genetic signal for EXT to assess their effects on tobacco use by sex and across the lifespan. Aim 1 will expand the original EXT GWAS, and curate phenotypic tobacco use and EXT traits in several cohorts which span across sex and multiple ages (e.g., Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD; ages 9-14+], Add Health [ages 12+], All of Us [ages 18+], UK Biobank [ages 40-69+], Psychiatric Genomics Consortium [ages 18+]). Phenotypic relationships amongst tobacco and EXT traits by sex will be inspected and sex-specific GWAS analyses of tobacco and EXT phenotypes will be performed. Aim 2 will assess the role of tobacco use and EXT polygenic scores across tobacco use and EXT behaviors by sex and over time in cohorts of different ancestries (e.g., European, African). Genetic liability for EXT may explain greater variance of tobacco use in adolescence, whereas specific genetic liability for tobacco dependence may become more important as individuals age.

Furthermore, Hp testing and treatment has not been commonly used in the US, drawing attention from KA community. In this proposal, we aim to further expand our growing community-academia partnership and broaden research capacity to develop appropriate public health interventions. Our aims are: (1) To strengthen collaborative capacity between USC, Koreatown Senior Community Center (KSCC), and community advisory board (CAB) to co-design a mixed method study on smoking and GC among KA smokers to identify actionable intervention targets. We will expand our current USC-KSCC-CAB collaboration, host annual town hall meetings and organize a “Smoke-free for Healthy Stomach” coalition engaging additional stakeholders for tobacco use and gastric health. (2) To assess how common Hp infection is among 200 active and passive KA smokers using a rapid non-invasive test and to assess changes in intention for reducing exposure to tobacco upon Hp detection, (3) To identify potential intervention targets to sustainably reduce tobacco exposure and Hp infection among KA families. We will invite 30 KA adults with Hp infection and their family members and conduct focus groups to discuss ways how health messaging should be written and delivered to reduce tobacco exposure and improve gastric health. We will disseminate findings via community-led efforts, media outlets, and publications. Results from this pilot will inform developing a full CPPRA application that has a high potential in identifying and testing culturally-appropriate intervention strategies.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Eunjung Lee,,,,University of Southern California,https://ror.org/03taz7m60,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-07-01,Issued,,T34CR8133H,award-number,,,,,,

For example, Black and Latiné youth tobacco product use increases the risk of addiction, reduced lung function, and early cardiovascular damage in the short term and contributes to tobacco-related health disparities (e.g., lung cancer) in the long term. It is therefore troubling that smoke shops—whose adverse public health effects remain poorly understood—are disproportionately located in Black and Latiné communities such as Westmont/West Athens, CA. Furthermore, smoke shops (1) are associated with increased rates of youth smoking initiation; (2) sell numerous e-cigarette products whose use is exploding among Black and Latiné youth; and (3) represent public nuisances that attract community crime and violence. However, no studies that we know of have examined the relationships between Black and Latiné youth tobacco product exposure and use within their everyday activity spaces (e.g., public parks, libraries, recreation centers), which our preliminary Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program-funded observational research suggests may be influenced by smoke shops in these communities. Building on our team’s community-partnered research, our two-year pilot study proposal seeks to address this gap by examining the following research question: How do smoke shops located in close proximity to youth activity spaces influence Black and Latiné youth exposure to and use of tobacco products in Westmont/West Athens? Working with Advocates for Peace and Urban Unity (Co-PI and Executive Director Kevin Orange), we will leverage our team’s strong community-academic partnership to engage youth and key stakeholders (e.g., parents, community organizers) in our research. First, we will use our team’s innovative participatory mapping approach to identify and categorize the primary activity spaces where youth are exposed to and use tobacco products and their proximity to smoke shops. Next, we will use photovoice to explore youth lived experience of tobacco product exposure and use around youth activity spaces and smoke shops.

While examinations of gender identity disparities in tobacco use have been well documented, less is known about how these disparities vary by race/ethnicity. Ample research has shown that SGM individuals smoke cigarettes due, at least in large part, to discrimination and other forms of minority stress. Research has also shown that racial/ethnic minorities such as African Americans, exhibit higher levels of stress (finances, relationship conflicts, and discrimination). However, little research exists on the intersection of sexual and gender minority and racial/ethnic identities and nicotine/tobacco use. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between stressors and tobacco use at the intersection of gender identity and race/ethnicity utilizing two population-based samples in California. Methods: Data will be obtained from Waves 3 and 4 of the ADVANCE study (n=~4,000), a longitudinal analysis of an ongoing study of behavioral health among Southern California high school students. Utilizing data from the ADVANCE study will allow us to examine the impact of discrimination stress on tobacco use among adolescents and young adults in Southern California. We will also use data from the Smoking Cessation in Sexual Minority Couples (SYNC) study (n=212), an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study to examine the impact of socioeconomic stress on tobacco use among sexual minority adults in California. Both studies will examine the role of race/ethnicity as a moderator of the relationship between self-reported stressors and tobacco use.

Head and neck cancers (HNC), the majority of which arise from tobacco use, are becoming increasingly common. Patients with HNC have poor response to available therapies and high mortality rates. The body’s immune system plays an integral part in killing cancer cells: increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating immune cells has been reported to correlate with better cancer prognosis. Boosting the immune response has thus been a considerable focus of cancer treatment strategies. However, the effectiveness of immune-boosting therapies in HNC remains unexpectedly low, highlighting the need for a better understanding of immune-tumor interactions in order to improve the treatment of HNC. In recent years, immunologists have gained insight into a subset of immune cells termed “tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells,” or “TRM” for short. Compared to other immune cell types, TRM possess a distinctive ability to surveil tissues and quickly respond to threats of infection and cancer growth. The robust function of TRM in tissues is thought to underlie improved patient outcomes in many cancer types such as colorectal, breast, and lung cancers. What is known about TRM mostly stem from studies in mouse models of infection and less so models of cancer. Furthermore, while TRM in many different organs have been investigated, our knowledge of the characteristics and function of TRM in head and neck tissues remain severely limited. Because of their unique protective capabilities, improving our understanding of basic TRM biology in the context of HNC potentiates new targets for boosting antitumor immunity for cancer treatment. In this proposal, I will study TRM in a mouse model of tobacco-associated HNC. This mouse HNC model shares 94% genetic similarity with human HNC, making my findings applicable to human disease. I will (1) characterize the properties of TRM in mouse HNC, and evaluate the tumor-fighting abilities of TRM compared to other immune cell types. In light of exploring novel therapeutic targets, I will also (2) identify cellular factors that regulate TRM in mouse HNC.

Early age and racial/ethnic minority status confer increased risk of using these products along with associated negative health outcomes. Youths are more vulnerable to nicotine addiction following exposure due to an earlier maturation of reward circuitry as compared with inhibitory control circuits in the brain. Furthermore, minority status is associated with the faster transition from initiation of tobacco product use to tobacco dependence. Neural mechanisms likely play a role as causes for these disparities. We propose that there are differences in habenula circuitry between school-aged youth who ultimately go on to use tobacco products compared with those who do not. Racial/ethnic minority status likely modulates possible differences. The habenula is a brain region that responds strongly to nicotine in animals and densely expresses the gene most strongly linked to nicotine dependence in humans. It also is implicated more generally in addiction-related behavior and negative affective states. As such, the circuitry of the habenula may have bearing on initiation and transition to heavy use of tobacco products. Yet the human habenula has eluded study because of its size and the difficulty in segmenting it from adjacent structures of the brain. We will use new analytical techniques that make it possible to segment the habenula from surrounding regions in brain scans using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and explore its functional connectivity in relation to vulnerability to tobacco product use during early adolescence. We will analyze data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD), which provides longitudinal MRI and smoking-related data from 11,875 children, including subsamples of individuals from different racial/ethnic minority groups. We will assess functional connectivity of the habenula to two targets in the brain: the ventral tegmental area, an important component of the brain’s reward circuitry, and the salience network, which is linked to nicotine dependence.

Various tobacco policies, including Tobacco 21, smoke-free outdoor policies, and, more recently, the banning of flavored tobacco products, have been introduced with the aim of reducing tobacco use and improving overall quality of life. Alongside these efforts, researchers have also examined harm reduction strategies such as Electronic Nicotine Device Systems (ENDS), which show evidence improving quit rates to help combat the upward trends in tobacco use. Although ENDS can improve quit rates among adults, they are also gaining popularity among youth. The 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) reported that 11.3% of high school and 2.8% of middle school students use ENDS. Over the past decade, ENDS has sparked a debate among tobacco researchers regarding the benefits versus risks of these products. While ENDS can serve as a harm reduction strategy, they are not an FDA-approved cessation tool and research has shown that these devices contain chemicals that can be harmful to one's health. Upon entering the market, ENDS products targeted young adults with alluring advertisements. Due to the growing concerns about ENDS, California Proposition 56 officially classified ENDS as tobacco products in 2016, subjecting them to all existing tobacco policies. Although tobacco policies are in place to reduce tobacco use, there is no standardized approach to assess their effectiveness. The American Lung Association (ALA) has developed state tobacco grades that evaluate the enforcement of tobacco policies at the state, city, and county levels. These grades are based on laws related to smoke-free outdoor air, smoke-free housing, reducing the sale of tobacco products, and, more recently, restrictions on flavored tobacco products. However, these grades have not been utilized in any study to assess the effectiveness of tobacco policies.

Tobacco use is a risk factor for oral cancer, and patients with tobacco-related oral cancer typically exhibit poor responses to current treatments. The challenge in treating tobacco-associated oral cancer lies in the absence of effective treatment options for the tumor and its surrounding immune environment. Our team discovered that the activation of a molecule known as mTOR in oral lesions that precede cancer contributes to their progression to malignancy. This indicates that reducing the activation of mTOR and its molecular network holds promise as a strategy to impede the progression of oral cancer from oral premalignant lesions. Interestingly, our lab showed that metformin, a safe drug used by millions of type 2 diabetes patients, can diminish mTOR activation in oral premalignant lesions and halt their progression to cancer. Based on these findings, our team conducted a Phase 2 trial in individuals with oral premalignant lesions to investigate metformin's potential in preventing oral cancer. The results from this clinical trial suggest that metformin use may reduce cancer progression. Notably, current and former smokers responded more favorably to metformin compared to never smokers. However, we still do not know the factors influencing metformin's efficacy in preventing the progression of oral premalignant lesions to oral cancer. My work will investigate the hypothesis that (1) the specific genetic alterations promoting mTOR activation in oral premalignant lesions and (2) the surrounding immune environment may dictate metformin's sensitivity. We will explore this hypothesis using recently developed mouse models that reflect closely the genetic complexity of tobacco-associated human oral cancer. Subsequently, we will validate our findings with collected information from our cancer prevention trial. By unraveling this knowledge, I aim to identify molecular alterations that can predict clinical responses to metformin and develop new drug combination strategies to enhance metformin’s efficiency.

Recurrence of AP is a risk factor for chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Tobacco smoking is a modifiable causal factor in pancreatitis and is commonly overlooked in medical management. Even when offered quit interventions, quit rates among patients are low. Pancreatitis causes intense pain, and patients report reliance on smoking and other substances for pain relief. Nicotine replacement to quit smoking is questioned based on evidence that nicotine itself may increase AP risk. Despite the unique and important need for pancreatitis patients to stop smoking, no tailored guidelines or tools are available for them. Given the rising rates of cannabis-induced pancreatitis, understanding how cannabis use (alone or combined with tobacco) impacts tobacco quitting behaviors is a major knowledge gap for this patient group. To better understand tobacco and cannabis behaviors in pancreatitis patients, with the long-term goal of developing more effective smoking cessation strategies for this population, we will investigate tobacco and cannabis use in one of the largest studies of pancreatitis patients being followed for recurrence. We will examine how tobacco and cannabis use impact the recurrence of AP. In addition, we will conduct a qualitative study of 30 participants to gain deeper insight into the tobacco use behaviors in the population, including awareness of the associated risk for recurrent disease and probing the role of stress and pain in use and quit behavior. The combined results will guide the design of interventional strategies to reduce tobacco and/or cannabis smoking in pancreatitis patients.

National surveys estimate that over 2.5 million middle and high school students are currently using e-cigarettes. High rates of adolescent e-cigarette use are concerning given documented health harms from e-cigarette use to adolescents’ heart, lungs, and brain. Health risks associated with adolescent e-cigarette use have prompted the development of prevention programs designed to reduce adolescent e-cigarette initiation and use. Though most prevention programs are designed for implementation in school settings, parents can also play an important role in preventing their adolescents’ general tobacco use through setting clear expectations and discussing health risks. However, many parents lack knowledge of e-cigarettes and their health harms, especially since e-cigarette designs, ingredients, and health harms change frequently. Parents’ poor knowledge and misperceptions regarding e-cigarettes are likely to undermine their efforts to proactively discuss e-cigarettes with their adolescents and prevent their initiation and use. Notably, there is a lack of up-to-date e-cigarette prevention programs designed for use by parents with their adolescents. To develop such programs, more research is required to assess parents’ knowledge and perceptions regarding e-cigarette products, and to determine the prevention content, messages, communication strategies, format, and resources that would be most beneficial to parents. To address these gaps, we will conduct surveys and focus groups with parents to assess their e-cigarette knowledge, perceptions, household rules about use, and communication strategies.

The majority of smokers report a desire to quit smoking; however only 3-5% of unaided quit attempts are successful. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation increases odds of abstinence, but the current FDA-approved options are associated with modest long-term quit rates that rarely exceed 30%. Furthermore, these medications are often accompanied by adverse events that deter utilization. There is a pressing need for alternative smoking cessation medications. A recent phase 3 clinical trial found cytisinicline, a naturally occurring plant-based alkaloid, to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated pharmacotherapy to promote smoking cessation.

There is no cure for COPD, therefore treatment focuses on alleviating patient symptoms. One of the most common symptoms reported by COPD patients is exercise intolerance. However, in COPD patients the standard measure of exercise intolerance (V̇O2peak) is poorly related to the severity of the decline in lung function. Therefore, although COPD is a ‘lung disease’, this well-appreciated finding affirms that leg muscle dysfunction also contributes to exercise intolerance in COPD patients. We have developed a new exercise test that adds the assessment of leg muscle performance to a standard test that measures V̇O2peak. This allows us to identify whether the “legs” or the “lungs” limit exercise tolerance. This test can also characterize how quickly leg muscle performance declines during an exercise test. Preliminary data, in healthy people, shows that leg muscle performance primarily limits exercise tolerance. However, in COPD patients the reserve in leg muscle performance at the point of exercise intolerance can be substantial. Moreover, the muscles that support breathing can also be dysfunctional in patients with COPD. It has been proposed that signals from these breathing muscles to the brain can result in exercise intolerance before the limits of leg muscle performance are reached. However, it is unclear how leg muscle performance declines during an exercise test in COPD patients. It is also unclear how breathing muscle dysfunction affects the decline in leg muscle performance and exercise tolerance in COPD patients. This project will 1.

These cancers are significant contributors to cancer-related deaths and are among the most common cancers worldwide. While treatments for these cancers have improved, there is still a need for better therapies to help patients live longer and improve their quality of life. A recent breakthrough in cancer treatment involves a new method called lysosome-targeted chimera (LYTAC), which was reported in the journal Nature by Carolyn Bertozzi’s research group. LYTAC targets proteins that promote cancer growth to either degrade or remove them. They've successfully tested this approach on several cancer-promoting proteins in cells, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, before this method can be used in clinics, its effectiveness in activating the immune system and controlling tumor growth in different animal models needs to be thoroughly tested. Our research has focused on a protein called galectin-1 (Gal-1), which is found in high levels in HNC and NSCLC. Gal-1 suppresses the immune system in cancer by binding to receptors on immune cells, leading to the death of anticancer T cells, promoting cancer-supporting T cells, and attracting immune-suppressing cells into tumors. Despite its potential as a target for immunotherapy, there is currently no effective treatment targeting Gal-1 available. In collaboration with Bertozzi’s group, we've developed the first LYTAC degrader called G-M6Pn, which can degrade Gal-1 in human HNC cells. Our study aims to investigate the effects of G-M6Pn on NSCLC cells and its ability to activate key immune cells, control tumor growth and metastasis, and improve survival rates in animal models by eliminating Gal-1. We also plan to explore how G-M6Pn can enhance tumor-killing immune responses when combined with radiotherapy in animal models. We hope that this research will lay the groundwork for using LYTAC degraders to improve the treatment outcomes of tobacco-related cancers in the future.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Yuyan Jiang,,,,Stanford University,https://ror.org/00f54p054,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-07-01,Issued,,T34FT8193,award-number,,,,,,

Among lung cancer subtypes, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common one and a leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Smoking tobacco is a major cause of lung cancer, which is responsible for approximately 90% of all cases. Tobacco-derived carcinogens induce mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, thereby triggering the transformation of normal lung cells to cancer cells. Among the susceptible genes, TP53, an essential tumour suppressor gene, is one of the most mutated genes in LUAD, with alterations in ~50% of LUAD. Mutations in TP53 are also associated with poor prognosis of lung cancer patients, indicating the critical roles of TP53 in restraining LUAD development and malignant transformation. P53 is a transcriptional activator protein that induces expression of a host of downstream target genes. Despite the crucial roles of TP53 in suppressing lung cancer initiation and progression, however, the underlying mechanisms by which p53 acts remain uncompletely understood. LUAD arises in the gas-exchange region of the lung, the alveoli, from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, cuboidal cells that secrete pulmonary surfactants and serve as a stem cells pools for generating additional AT2 cells and for differentiation into thin and quiescent alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells which mediate gas exchange. During lung injury repair, AT2 cells are activated to proliferate and form cells known as transitional cells, which eventually differentiate into AT1 cells. Importantly, our recent studies in mouse models revealed that p53 is activated in transitional cells during injury repair and in response to oncogenic insults in the lung. We showed further that p53 inactivation prevents transitional cells from becoming AT1 cells in LUAD and in tissue regeneration after injury. Our findings suggest that p53 restricts LUAD by promoting an AT1 differentiation gene expression program, but the genes required for p53 to induce AT1 differentiation are unknown. In addition, whether AT1 differentiation is critical for p53-mediated tumor suppression is unclear. Our experiments will address these two questions. Achieving these goals will shed light on mechanisms of p53 action in suppressing LUAD development, thereby opening new opportunities for lung cancer prevention and treatment.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Kha Nguyen,,,,Stanford University,https://ror.org/00f54p054,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-07-01,Issued,,T34FT8225,award-number,,,,,,

With the rising use of e-cigarettes across different age groups and the legalization of cannabis in many U.S. states, it has become crucial to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of nicotine and cannabinoid co-exposure on neural development and function. Maintaining proper placental development and function is vital for a healthy pregnancy and the well-being of the developing fetus. Any factors influencing placental maturation can potentially disrupt fetal growth and development. Both nicotine and delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) found in cannabis can cross the placenta and blood-brain barrier, concentrating in fetal blood and amniotic fluid. The primary objective of this research is to explore the effects of nicotine and cannabinoid co-exposure during pregnancy on communication between the placenta and fetus, neural development and cognitive flexibility. To achieve this, the proposed studies will systematically investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to vaped e-cigarette nicotine and THC on the molecular extracellular mechanism between the placenta and fetus, as well as its genetic implications. To study these effects, a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches will be utilized, focusing on how vapor co-exposure of nicotine and THC during pregnancy influences extracellular communication in the placenta-fetus axis, potentially altering extracellular vesicles (EV) cargo and increasing vulnerability to cognitive flexibility in adolescent rats. The data obtained from this study will significantly contribute to our fundamental knowledge of how prenatal drug exposure affects the critical placenta-fetus communication mechanism neural function and cognitive flexibility.

Tobacco induced cancer develops with unique alterations in a carbohydrate (or “sugar”) layer of molecules on the tumor-cell surface known as the glycocalyx. In discovery work, we found that applying an external “pulsed” magnetic field to lung cancer cells may induce novel electric forces (EMFs) that engage with charged sugars uniquely enriched on the glycocalyx of the cancer cells, inducing tumor-cell leak and reduced tumor cell viability. The pulsed fields appear to engage with tumor glycans to disrupt the integrity of the tumor cell’s surface or membrane. Such unique sugars are expressed heavily on the glycocalyx of lung tumors, and might thus represent a novel “Achilles heel” or vulnerability of lung cancer cells to treatment using pulsed magnetic fields, while normal cells appear to be spared in studies thus far. Biophysical approaches to target lung cancer remain under-explored, and we aim to study how pulsed magnetic fields target lung cancer cell systems, including pilot work to inhibit the growth of tobacco-induced model human lung tumors in mice. This may facilitate novel therapeutic approaches to eradicate tumor cells without classical radiation or chemotherapy that can damage normal surrounding body cells. We hypothesize that EMFs generated by pulsed magnetic fields can: (1) engage with unique “charged glycan” arrays on the glycocalyx of tobacco induced lung cancer cells to disrupt tumor membrane integrity, and (2) inhibit cancer-cell viability in human lung tumor models growing in mice treated with short exposures to the novel pulsed fields. Lung cancer recurs frequently, and non-toxic strategies to cure micro-metastatic disease are needed. Applying pulsed magnetic fields in a treatment setting may potentially eradicate “visible and invisible” tumor with high impact. In addition, proposed pilot studies will inform the specific impact on tobacco-induced lung cancers, including any unique susceptibility of their glycocalyx to pulsed fields. Finally, we have an eye to the fact that the cancer glycocalyx is known to augment a cancer’s invasive potential, so the use of pulsed fields to target glycocalyx-rich tumor cells may uniquely eradicate highly invasive tumor cell subsets to further improve outcomes.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Mark Fuster,,,,Veterans Medical Research Foundation,https://ror.org/03cth7012,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-07-01,Issued,,T34IP8073,award-number,,,,,,

Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer and is heavy associated with smoking. Lung adenocarcinoma can metastasize to many different organs, including the liver, brain, and back to the lung. Many different genes are mutated in lung adenocarcinoma in different patients. The collection of genes that are mutated in a tumor is called the tumor “genotype"". Despite this diversity of genes mutated in lung adenocarcinoma the contribution of the tumor genotype to metastatic ability remains largely unexplored. To determine the extent that genotype drives different aspect of metastasis, we will integrate cutting-edge multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 somatic genome editing and tumor barcoding with in vivo metastases assays. This will uncover which genotypes drive metastatic ability across different organ sites. Understanding how tumor genotype influences metastatic ability could have prognostic implications and ultimately uncover targetable pro-metastatic pathways. Primary tumors often create an immunosuppressive environment, however when cancers try to metastasize to other organs the cancer cells are re-exposed to immune detection. Thus, metastatic cancer cells likely possess or acquire specific adaptations. While some tumor genotypes have been suggested to reduce anti-cancer immune responses, understanding the extent to which genotype contributes to immune evasion has implication for immunotherapy treatment of lung cancer patients. By quantifying the impact of genotype on the ability of metastases to seed and grow at different sites, we will uncover genotypes that enable lung cancer cells to evade immune destruction at some of all distant sites. For the past decade my laboratory has been dedicated to studying lung cancer. We have investigated lung cancer metastasis and developed new methods to better uncover how genotype impact different clinically relevant aspects of lung cancer.

Smoking is the most important risk factor for adverse outcomes during and after surgery. Rates of smoking at the time of surgery are high, 22.3-43.0%, particularly among Veterans and people with health disparities. Smoking at the time of surgery is associated with complications, reoperations, and mortality. Despite these risks, smoking cessation treatment is often not integrated into surgical care. CM promotes smoking cessation by providing financial rewards for quitting. CM for smoking cessation has been shown to improve quit rates, but studies reveal that CM is most likely to work when tailored for the patient population. CM for smoking cessation has never been conducted before and after major surgery. Advances in mobile technology allow for remote (mobile) monitoring of carbon monoxide (CO) to confirm smoking abstinence for outpatients receiving CM. We will develop the first-of-its-kind mobile CM smoking cessation protocol for Veterans undergoing major elective surgery. We will consult with a Community Advisory Panel of Veteran patient advocates and content experts on CM, surgery, and VA healthcare policy about methods for CM delivery. The panel will advise on timing and approach of CM for VA surgery patients. In a 5-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will randomly assign 36 Veteran smokers undergoing major elective surgery to receive 5 weeks of CM with mobile CO monitoring or treatment as usual (TAU), referral to a VA smoking cessation clinic and quitline. Both groups will receive smoking cessation medication. We will measure feasibility of smoking cessation CM at the time of surgery by tracking recruitment, engagement, and retention in the study. We will also assess the effect of CM compared to TAU on smoking cessation outcomes, including quit attempts; cigarettes per day; nicotine dependence; and quit rates. This innovative study is the first to deliver CM before and after major surgery, and targets a high-priority California tobacco population, military Veterans.

New evidence indicates that endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary arteries contributes to PH. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. We and others reported that miR-483 promotes a healthy pulmonary endothelium, and decreased levels of miR-483 lead to endothelial dysfunction. In relation to CS-induced lung injury, miR-483 can convert to its oxidized form, namely, oxidized miR-483 under harmful conditions such as CS. Consequently, this change aggravates PH.

Nicotine use is strongly associated with dental caries, an oral disease prevalent in this age group. The cooperative relationship between important dental caries-causing bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Sm) and fungus (Candida albicans, Ca) is an important factor in dental caries development. On the other hand, beneficial bacteria like Streptococcus sanguinis (Ss) can prevent Sm growth, attach to Ca, and reduce Ca growth. However, their interactions in caries development and the influence of Ss on the Sm-Ca relationship are unclear. Recent studies have shown that pure nicotine (N) can stimulate the cooperative relationship between Sm and Ca and increase the growth of Sm when grown together with Ss. Although there are indications that N has an enhanced effect on causing dental caries, most research studies have focused on N instead of nicotine vape aerosols (N-VA) produced by e-cigarettes. Additionally, very limited studies have been conducted on the effect of N-VA on Sm, Ss, and Ca. Our previous study and supporting data for this study showed that at the same nicotine content, the response of Sm and Ca to N was different from N-VA, which led us to hypothesize that nicotine vape aerosol affects the dynamic relationship between Sm, Ca, and Ss and potentially impacts dental caries disease differently than pure nicotine. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effect of N-VA on the Sm-Ss-Ca relationship compared to N using a well-characterized bacteria line to evaluate co-adhesion, biofilm formation, sugar-based substances produced by bacteria, acid production, and transcriptome (gene expression).

It increases the risk of atherosclerosis which causes plaque to build up in artery walls, including those which supply heart muscle. When plaque narrows vessels in the heart, it can restrict blood flow to the heart and lead to angina (chest pain) when the oxygen requirements of the heart outstrip that supplied by the blood vessels. In addition, when a plaque ruptures, it can trigger a blood clot to be formed, leading to total occlusion of a coronary (heart) vessel, causing a heart attack, known as a myocardial infarction (MI). With MI, irreversible death of heart muscle cells occurs, and also heart rhythm can be so disturbed that the heart cannot pump adequately, often leading to sudden and immediate death. Therefore, finding new ways to protect the heart from decreased blood flow will help patients suffering from tobacco-related coronary heart disease. Mitochondria, which are small organelles inside heart muscle cells, are responsible for energy production that is essential for normal heart function. When mitochondrial function is disturbed, it can exacerbate heart muscle cell death. Emerging evidence shows that reduced blood supply (ischemia) can cause mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to heart muscle cell death and heart dysfunction. In the proposed project, we will study the role of Perm1, a novel mitochondrial regulator, in ischemic injury using genetically engineered mouse models. Our hypothesis is that the Perm1 protein protects heart muscle cells from the damage they can incur with decreased blood supply. By using gene manipulations, we have made mice with increased and decreased Perm1 expression in the heart. We will use these mice to study the function of Perm1 in the heart. In addition, we will also study the potential mechanism(s) by which Perm1 protects the heart from the damage caused by a decreased blood supply.

IPF patients survive for only about 3-5 years. To date, the exact cause of the IPF is unclear but cigarette smoking (CS) is believed is one of the risks. CS causes the damage of alveolar epithelial cell (cells that line air sac), which produce the scar-promoting molecule leading to IPF. One of the damages the CS induced is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (a place where protein is produced) stress, which is known to play pivotal roles in the development of IPF. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is a protein that induce cell death when cells response to ER stress. We have reported that ER stress induced by loss of a protein called GRP78 in alveolar epithelial cell can lead to lung fibrosis in a mouse model called Grp78 knockout (KO) mice. Our preliminary data in Grp78/Chop double KO mice further demonstrated that CHOP is a key factor involved in the development of lung fibrosis. We also observed CS exposure increased CHOP expression and lung fibrosis in the slices of Grp78 KO and IPF lung culture. These data lead us to study a hypothesize that CS worsen the damage of alveolar epithelial cell and lung fibrosis through the induction of much severer ER stress, with a specific emphasis on CHOP. To validate this hypothesis, we will: 1) Explore whether CS worsen AT2 damage and lung fibrosis through CHOP using AT2 cells and lungs from Grp78 KO and Grp78/CHOP double KO mice, as well as from IPF patients and normal donors who are smokers and non-smokers. 2) Identify new factors contributing to CS-induced AEC damage and lung fibrosis using techniques such as RNA sequencing and ATAC-Sequencing on AT2 cells from IPF patients and normal donors who are smokers and non-smokers.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Beiyun Zhou,,,,University of Southern California,https://ror.org/03taz7m60,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-07-01,Issued,,T34IR7962,award-number,,,,,,

Motivational interviewing (MI) successfully enhances patients’ motivation to quit smoking by evoking their ambivalence about quitting.

Regulation of drug-induced behaviors via translated small open reading frames (smORFs) has been overlooked in addiction neuroscience. We have identified a 3' untranslated region (UTR) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the alpha(α)6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit (encoded by the CHRNA6 gene) that appears to regulate nicotine addiction. Our data show that this SNP leads to a two-fold increase in nicotine seeking and substance use in rodents and humans, respectively. The results are unique as studies in the field thus far have focused on SNPs in the coding regions of the genome. Our laboratory has engineered a CHRNA6 3' UTRC123G SNP mutant rat line that replicates the genetic variation in humans in order to functionally validate the mechanisms of enhanced nicotine use.

However, the potential health implications of vaping for pregnant women and their fetuses remain largely unknown. Moreover, it is unknown if and how this adverse effect on the unborn babies will persist into their postnatal and adulthood. To tackle this health issue, we propose this project. The rigor of this proposal is based on prior studies that e-cig products exert more pronounced toxic effects on embryonic cells compared to their adult counterparts, culminating in fetal growth restriction. This suggests a distinctive vulnerability of the developing fetus to e-cig-induced toxicity. Recently, we have developed a pregnant rat model of e-cig exposure. Our preliminary data unveiled a link between e-cig exposure and amplified ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced heart injury and subsequent heart failure in adult offspring associated with alterations in cardiomyopathy and ischemia-sensitive markers. Building upon these pivotal findings, we hypothesize that prenatal e-cig exposure engenders modifications in fetal cardiac genes via an epigenetic mechanism, thus perpetuating into adulthood and instigating a dysfunctional cardiac phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we first will determine if fetal e-cig exposure causes heart dysfunction in adult offspring. Then, we aim to pinpoint cardiac dysfunctional markers specifically associated with e-cig exposure. Additionally, we will ascertain the epigenetic marker responsible for regulating cardiac fetal gene expression, specifically focusing on FTO/m6A RNA methylation. Finally, we will employ pharmacological and gene therapeutic interventions to gauge if restoring FTO-dependent m6A methylation ameliorates the e-cig-induced heart dysfunction phenotype.

California has the highest rates of homelessness in the U.S., with 171,521 PEH on any given day, which is about one-fifths of the nation’s PEH. About half of the population experiencing homelessness in California resides in Los Angeles and San Francisco counties, the two counties that are the focus of this proposal. A 2023 study on California homelessness confirmed the high rates of cigarette smoking among PEH—70% among PEH compared to 6.2% in California and 11% nationally. PEH have lower rates of successful cessation than the general population, despite making similar number of quit attempts. To address these gaps, we conducted a pilot intervention using an innovative model leveraging community pharmacists to provide one-time tobacco treatment using the 5As (Ask, Advice, Assess, Assist and Arrange) model and arranged for monthly delivery of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for 3 months (“pharm-only”) to PEH staying in a homeless shelter in San Francisco, CA. The pharm-only intervention reduced consumption and increased quitting behaviors, but participants endorsed long-term behavioral and medication support to quit completely. In this proposal, we build on the 3-month pharm-only intervention by developing a protocol for an Extended Intervention for Tobacco use (EXIT) for PEH that consists of: 1) a single session of pharmacist-delivered 5As and monthly delivery of NRT for 6 months, and 2) health coach-delivered, weekly-to-monthly wellness-focused telephone coaching for 6 months addressing tobacco use within the context of co-occurring psychiatric and substance-use comorbidities. We will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy on tobacco abstinence by conducting a randomized controlled trial of EXIT vs. the pharm-only intervention among 150 PEH staying in transitional shelters or short-term hotels in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California.

Approximately 15% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a highly aggressive cancer. SCLC is strikingly associated with tobacco: approximately 95% of SCLC patients have a history of tobacco use, and smoking cessation is currently the most effective primary prevention strategy. However, there are no effective treatments for patients with SCLC, who have an overall 5-year survival rate of <8%. Previously, SCLC cells were found to be sensitive to small molecule inhibitors that target a family of proteins called poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases (or PARPs) that are involved in DNA repair. While there was a great deal of excitement around the possibility that PARP inhibitors could be effective treatments for SCLC, clinical trials disappointingly demonstrated that this class of inhibitors had only mixed results in patients. Understanding how SCLC resist PARP inhibitors and finding new drugs that overcome this resistance could greatly benefit patients with SCLC, who urgently need more effective treatment options. Genome-scale screens have recently identified a helicase (an enzyme that unwinds DNA) as a key driver of resistance to PARP inhibition. As such, drugging this helicase may boost the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors in SCLC. However, helicases in general have been difficult to drug, and there are no FDA-approved helicase inhibitors for cancer. To overcome this, we recently discovered small molecules that induce the degradation of this helicase and found that this could sensitize SCLC cells to PARP inhibition in cell culture models. Here, we propose to optimize our lead compounds so that they are suitable for use in mouse models of SCLC. If successful, we will have identified a novel therapeutic target for overcoming resistance to PARP inhibitors in SCLC. Moreover, we will have demonstrated that it is druggable, and our optimized compound will be poised for rapid development for future clinical studies.

However, the full manifestation of diseases takes time. Hence, healthcare costs related to tobacco use and secondhand exposure among kids might not fully capture the short-run economic impact. Tobacco use and secondhand exposure are more likely to lead to kids missing school (absenteeism) and having behavior/learning problems. Research has found that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder resulting from secondhand smoke exposure imposes a burden on schools four times greater than on the healthcare system. Tobacco use and secondhand exposure among kids will impact schools in various ways, including funding losses due to absenteeism, increased costs associated with addressing and reducing tobacco use, counseling for behavioral issues related to tobacco use, and managing hazardous tobacco product waste. School resource reduction can jeopardize educational quality, potentially exacerbating tobacco-related disparities. Unfortunately, little scientific attention has been given to schools' financial burdens in this context. Our study delves into the school costs attributable to youth tobacco use (ages 12-17) and secondhand exposure in children (ages 6-11) at home. Given the popularity of cannabis use among California youth and the similar but unknown effects of cannabis use on school funding loss from absenteeism and school costs, we will also consider the impacts of youth cannabis use for a more comprehensive analysis. We will estimate California annual school funding losses from absenteeism associated with the use of e-cigarettes, combustible tobacco, cannabis for youth, and secondhand tobacco exposure at home for children. We will also examine the disparities in funding losses by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and rural/urban residency. Lastly, we will estimate the economic impact of youth tobacco and cannabis use on school costs, considering costs related to waste management, support programs, and monitoring efforts and comparing these costs across urban and rural schools.

Together, COPD and CVD are the 1st-3rd leading causes of death worldwide. Over the past several years, we and others have unfortunately found that chronic use of e-cigarette tobacco products is not without risk, with detrimental alterations in inflammation, physiology, and immune function. Most recently, in a pilot study utilizing human subjects recruited in 2017, we found significant pulmonary and systemic inflammatory and innate immune (neutrophil and monocyte) changes in e-cigarette users. These findings support our hypothesis that chronic use of e-cigarettes will lead to both lung and systemic inflammation and downstream diseases, and thus propagate tobacco related diseases. In this proposal we leverage airway and blood samples obtained from human subjects recruited via our TRDRP High Impact Pilot Award and Supplement (2019-2022) to define the inflammatory changes and immunomodulation caused by chronic use of 4th generation, high-nicotine, pod-based e-cigarettes. Further, our survey-based studies and recruitment of human subjects have both found a high rate of dual use of nicotine e-cigarettes with inhaled forms of cannabis, particularly vaped tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

In California, 18% of high school students used electronic vapor products on at least one day in the past 30 days. Exposure to social media advertising is associated with e-cigarette use among youth. Social media influencers are regarded as more trusted and authentic than traditional advertising. We identified engaging micro-influencers (users with 1,000-100,000+) followers who promote e-cigarettes. Some of these influencers are based in California. Their posts frequently have non-compliant disclosures of partnerships with tobacco brands and/or lack the FDA-required nicotine warning labels and age restrictions, in violation of the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) marketing restrictions. Influencers who promote e-cigarettes also use audio-visual effects in promotional pots, including stylization of influencers to look young, use of popular songs, autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) sounds or motivational narration and depiction of e-cigarettes in attractive and youth-oriented lifestyle contexts (e.g., healthy lifestyle, technology, gaming). These tactics could diminish adolescents’ harm perceptions of e-cigarettes, contribute to normalization of e-cigarette use, and expose e-cigarette never-users to e-cigarette content. Data from our adolescent surveys and focus groups show that influencers who were perceived as “young-looking,” who showed e-cigarettes as part of their daily life (e.g., using e-cigarettes and exercising) or used novel marketing features like ASMR were considered more relatable compared to influencers who look “older,” who overtly promote e-cigarettes without any non-substance-use context, or who did not use novel marketing features. To understand the impact of these marketing tactics on California youth, the proposed study will conduct randomized online experiments and in-person eye-tracking experiments to analyze the effects of audio-visual components of e-cigarette influencer marketing that could contribute to normalization of e-cigarette use.

Despite tremendous gains in the alcohol literature, little research has investigated the role of parental nicotine use history on level of response to acute nicotine, and whether changes in brain function in response to acute nicotine prior to regular nicotine use and during peak, overlapping periods of neural development and heightened substance use (e.g., ages 18-25), predict important substance use outcomes. The sensitivity model suggests that those who experience greater positive effects from initial experimentation with nicotine are at greater risk for nicotine dependence. However, prospective data examining early-life objective brain-behavior markers to acute nicotine in individuals with and without parental nicotine use histories and its relation to future nicotine use does not exist. Initial response to nicotine (a highly addictive chemical compound) may serve as an early-life vulnerability that could contribute to and predict NTP and other substance use and addiction-related behaviors over time. This project will recruit 100 young adults with positive or negative parental nicotine use histories to undergo an initial baseline protocol followed by a remote follow-up interview 18 months later.

At both baseline visits, following drug administration, participants will receive a resting pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) scan to assess nicotine-related changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to assess nicotine-related changes to neural markers of cognitive processing, and complete subjective measures of nicotine response. The 18-month follow-up interview will involve remote substance use assessments. Broadly, the aims of the study are to (1) determine whether early-life neurobehavioral and subjective markers are altered by acute nicotine exposure and (2) determine whether level of response to nicotine at ages 18-19 predicts substance-related outcomes 1.5 years later and whether these relationships are moderated by parental history of nicotine use.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Kelly Courtney,,,,"University of California, San Diego",https://ror.org/0168r3w48,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-07-01,Issued,,T34IR8391,award-number,,,,,,

It is known to have a diverse set of predisposing etiologies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms involved remain incompletely understood. Recently, disruption of circadian rhythms, a highly conserved phenomenon in most mammalian tissues and organs, has been linked to inflammation, premature aging, and playing a significant role in the lung health of adults. For example, jet lag and cigarette smoking are known to disrupt clock gene expression; and persons who work irregular hours are more prone to the development of asthma and CLD. However, the role of the molecular clock in the developing lung has remained largely understudied. New evidence suggests that molecular clock expression in the lung is present early in the fetus, making circadian rhythms a potentially highly relevant factor in lung development and later pulmonary morbidity. This is also highly pertinent since smoking during pregnancy and lactation is strongly linked to CLD, however, its impact on clock genes that regulate the circadian rhythm is unknown. Due to the recent increase in the use of electronic cigarettes by pregnant women, this issue has become even more relevant. Using our well-established rat and human lung tissue models and elegant genetic models, we propose to examine the effects of tobacco smoke and nicotine exposure during pregnancy and lactation on the circadian clock genes. In addition, we also propose to examine the effects of a novel class of drugs, i.e., clock gene modulators, known as chronotherapeutics, with the goal to block perinatal smoke exposure and electronic vaping related lung morbidities such as predisposition to asthma, premature aging, and CLD. Despite all efforts, approximately 10% of U.S. women smoke during pregnancy, resulting in at least 450,000 smoke-exposed infants per year, rendering the work proposed here highly pertinent. Given our previous significant contributions to advance the mechanistic understanding of tobacco smoke/nicotine-induced programming of the developing lung, we are confident that the proposed work will not only provide novel therapeutic targets to prevent nicotine-induced CLD but will also significantly advance TRDRP’s mission to end all commercial tobacco products in California by the year 2035.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Virender Rehan,,,,Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center,https://ror.org/025j2nd68,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-07-01,Issued,,T34IR8406,award-number,,,,,,

While California (CA) remains a leader of the nation’s tobacco control efforts, an estimated 2.8 million residents continue to smoke. Attractive marketing, high levels of nicotine, and flavoring make tobacco products highly enticing and addictive leading to initiation and prolonged use. To impede smoking-related death and disease, several cigarette-specific federal regulatory actions may be taken, including: 1) banning menthol flavors, 2) reducing nicotine; and 3) requiring graphic health warning labels. Not wishing to wait for federal action, CA began prohibiting the sale of all flavored tobacco products including menthol cigarettes. Considering, “As goes California, so goes the nation”, the tobacco industry attempted to stop CA’s flavor ban but were unsuccessful. As a result, they instead began circumventing the law by developing replacements for flavored products such as ‘non-menthol’ cigarettes and ‘clear’ e-cigarettes, which contain artificial cooling agents that impart a cooling effect but lack a minty odor or flavor. Given the rise in popularity of e-cigarettes, authorization of heated tobacco products, use of new cooling agents, it is critical to understand how preferences for tobacco products may shift in response to these regulations and industry actions. Several questions are unanswered: Will former menthol smokers’ preferences shift to replacement “non-menthol” cigarettes? Will regulatory actions change smokers’ preferences for non-combusted tobacco products? Will shifts in tobacco product preferences differ among sociodemographic populations, and could this lead to widening health disparities? This project will answer these questions by employing a set of experimental tobacco purchase tasks in which smokers’ make hypothetical purchase decisions designed to uncover their preferences for various tobacco products (cigarettes, e-cigarettes, heated tobacco) and their accompanying features (flavors, nicotine, warnings) and determine their willingness to pay (or avoid) such features.

However, how smoking and e-cigarette use lead to periodontitis still remain to be completely understood. We have previously shown that molecules from combustible cigarette smoke can stimulate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and facilitate infection in oral cells. Here we propose to investigate the role of AhR activation by combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes on infection with periodontal pathogens, and on innate immune responses against the periodontal pathogens in human oral cells. We will evaluate whether combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes modulate microbial infection in oral cells via AhR activation. We will also examine whether combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes modulate the host response called “inflammasome” to oral microbes in human oral cells via AhR activation. Inflammasomes are a group of proteins that can sense cellular stress or damage and can initiate an inflammatory response. Our findings will help better understand the cellular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of tobacco-related periodontitis. As pharmacological activators and inhibitors of AhR are already being developed, our findings may raise the possibility of targeting AhR therapeutically for treatment of smoking-induced diseases.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Cassio Luiz Coutinho Almeida da Silva,,,,University of the Pacific,https://ror.org/005gk0s47,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-07-01,Issued,,T34KT8265,award-number,,,,,,

Tobacco dependence is high in the SUD population and treatment increases the likelihood of SUD treatment success. Historically, SUD treatment programs have been reticent to integrate tobacco treatment that ultimately led to recent legislative action in the form of Assembly Bill 541, which mandates screening and tobacco treatment at outpatient treatment facilities. Despite this effort, inpatient touchpoints remain a critical care gap for treating tobacco among patients with SUD. CA Bridge is a statewide, hospital-based program whose goal is to ensure every hospital in California has the capability to treat SUD. The program advises patients, connects them to inpatient and outpatient treatment, and follows-up after discharge. The CA Bridge SUD program treats opiates and other substances, yet tobacco treatment is not part of the protocol. Given the broad reach of CA Bridge, supplementation of existing inpatient services with tobacco care may prove critical to reduce tobacco use among people with SUD in California, a priority population with a high burden of tobacco use and related disease. This proposed study will test an intervention to introduce tobacco treatment to patients with SUD admitted to UC Davis Hospital—a CA Bridge program leader. The intervention will compare usual care (UC-TT) with inpatient pharmacist-delivered tobacco treatment (PD-TT); which will offer nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and connect patients to quitline services. This study has two objectives. First, to refine and implement the PD-TT protocols with SUD treatment stakeholders at UC Davis Hospital for patients with SUD. Second, to evaluate implementation by assessing rates of NRT inpatient and at discharge, discharge quitline orders, and connection to quitline services among patients with SUD. The long-term goal of this study is to fill a gap in the continuum of tobacco-related care by providing patients with SUD tobacco treatment in an inpatient setting.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Iraklis Erik Tseregounis,,,,"University of California, Davis",https://ror.org/05rrcem69,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-07-01,Issued,,T34KT8277,award-number,,,,,,

NCPC is the only tobacco-related research center in California’s San Joaquin Valley (SJV) and serves all eight counties of the Valley, as well as three adjacent counties in the Sierra Foothills. Collectively, these counties represent a region with higher tobacco use, weaker tobacco control policies, and a higher burden of disease and death. Since its inception in 2018, NCPC has established itself as a unifying entity that provides essential support to regional tobacco control programs and community organizations. Activities within NCPC align with three major goals: a) to generate empirical data focused on SJV, b) disseminate data to community organizations and tobacco/cannabis stakeholders, and c) build the community’s capacity to support, create, and implement evidenced-based tobacco/cannabis prevention and control policies. The current application resubmission describes a revised strategic plan and programmatic goals for NCPC. This submission extends the work building on the existing foundation of NCPC. We incorporate lessons learned in the past four five years, as well as direct community input on regional needs. Specifically, NCPC will respond to community calls for 1) community-level support for tailored tobacco and cannabis prevention and cessation needs unique to SJV and 2) broader community involvement to support tobacco control activities and broaden awareness of California Endgame initiative. Activities include community-academic partnerships in tobacco policy implementation assessments, citizen scientist-led ambulatory data collection and information dissemination, and data dashboards that will be broadly disseminated to communities through infographics, visualized data, video series, and in-person consultations. Rapid research activities will include SJV-based data dashboard reflecting community partners' existing data collection and analysis of tobacco/nicotine retail environment. The proposed activities will leverage NCPC’s existing role in the region as a connector between formerly disparate organizations, as well as a key partner in critical research and policy development that will provide data and resources to the San Joaquin Valley and local Sierra Foothills.",Abstract,ProjectLeader,Irene Yen,,,,"University of California, Merced",https://ror.org/00d9ah105,ROR,https://ror.org/,2024-07-01,Issued,,T34PC8131,award-number,,,,,,
